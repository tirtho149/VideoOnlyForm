  "description": "Mrs. Tuyết is the member who wears the red coat in the photo. She is married with three children. Her family is living in a small house in a village in Quang Xuong district, a rural area in Thanh Hoa province. Tuyết has operated a food stall selling salt for 10 years.<br /><br />In this group, Tuyết’s circumstances are the poorest. Her oldest child had to drop out of school when he was 15 years old. Tuyết must work hard to keep the two younger children in school. Her main income is from her salt stall; in addition, she tries to rise poultry and plant vegetables for more income. The main hardship that Tuyết faces is a lack of capital. <br /><br />Tuyết joined Thanh Hoa Microfinance Institution to improve her business. She is requesting a loan to purchase more salt to resell. <br /><br />With the business profit, Tuyết hopes for her family to be healthy and happy, to make enough money to provide for her kids, and to keep sending her children to school.",
