  "description": "Maira is a 41 year old woman.  She is a single mother of three children, of whom two are still younger in age, and she lives with them in a neighborhood in the city of Cartagena de Indias.  She is a small business owner who makes footwear, a job that she learned in an entity of the state, specializing in technical and technological training.  When she finished her studies, she began her business project in which she now has 10 years of experience.<br /><br />Her line of footwear is distinctly feminine and her main customers are her neighbors, friends, and relatives.  She put a display case in the living room of her home to exhibit her creations.  In this way she promotes her sales without being outside of the house.<br /><br />In the end of the year season, she wants to make an investment to buy seasonal merchandise and increase her profits.  That is why she is applying for her first Kiva loan through Fundación Mario Santo Domingo to buy leather, glue, soles, paints, and accessories.  Maira has set goals including expanding her production and saving.",
