  "Name": "Mary's Group",
  "description": "Mary is a 29-year-old woman with six children. She is a group leader, and is representing her group, which was formed by 16 farmers in the Teso District of Kenya. <br /><br />Mary has been farming with One Acre Fund for years, having joined the program for the first time in 2012. The decision to join was largely a result of her desire to have access to quality training and to learn new farming methods. Although she described her last harvest as excellent, she believes she could have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. <br /><br />Mary also decided to purchase a solar light with part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to have light during dark hours for her children to study.<br /><br />This loan will allow Mary's Group to purchase a total of 18 solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 2.75 acres.",
