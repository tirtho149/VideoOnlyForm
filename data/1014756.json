  "Name": "Saúl",
  "description": "Saúl is 28 years old. He studied up to the seventh grade. He is married and his partner works as a housekeeper. They do not have any children for the moment, but they hope to become parents in the future. They live alone in a humble house made with metal sheets, recently built with the savings he had.<br /><br />Saúl is always smiling, because working and getting ahead makes him feel happy. He has worked since he was a young boy in agriculture and animal husbandry. He currently works in a cattle farm, where he milks the cows and irrigates his boss's plantations.<br /><br />Saúl wakes up very early every day to go to work, at four in the morning. He returns in when it starts to get dark, or when there is more work to be done, when it is dark. He has now many years of experience in his activity, and one can see in his face that he feels satisfied.<br /><br />He needs a lot of help with this loan to buy organic and chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and pay for the labor needed to plant squash. He is sure he will receive this support; right now he does not have the money, so he would not be able to sow his crops in time.<br /><br />Saúl is a man full of hope. This is why he dreams of continuing to work hard, and of improving his life little by little. He hopes to achieve this with Kiva's help, for which he is thankful and in high spirits.",
