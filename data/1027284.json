  "Name": "Helda's Group",
  "description": "Helda is 44 years old and has six children. She is a group leader and is representing her group formed by 16 farmers in Teso District, Kenya.  She has been farming with One Acre Fund for years now, having joined the program for the first time in 2012. This decision was largely as a result of her desire to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods. Although she described her last harvest as very good, she believes she could have a better one this year by continuing to work alongside One Acre Fund. <br /><br />Helda also decided to purchase a solar light as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money. Obtaining this loan means that Helda's Group will be able to receive a total of 13 solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 7 acres.",
