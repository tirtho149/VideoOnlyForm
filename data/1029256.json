  "description": "Ricardo, age 62, went to school up through third grade of primary school.  He is married, and his wife works in natural flower sales.  They have four children, but only one lives with them.<br /><br />Like his wife, Ricardo has worked in natural flower sales for many years.  He lives in a zone where rose fields are good.  He set up his business some time ago, and in this way he and his wife have been able to get ahead, since people buy many of their flowers.  Before, he also sold products such as belts, razors, and needles, among other things.<br /><br />He needs this loan to buy more seeds in order to grow more roses.  This will allow him to have more products to sell and to improve his harvests.<br /><br />His dream is to keep working in this business that he likes so much and which has been the vehicle to support his family.",
