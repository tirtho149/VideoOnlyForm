  "description": "Pictured above is Eunice, often described as an extremely hardworking individual. She is 24 years old and, as a group leader, she is representing her group of 10 farmers in Chwele District, Kenya.  She is married and has two children.<br /><br />Eunice is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again as this means that she is able to get the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds, which is why she decided to join in the first place. Eunice says that she is happy to have made that decision because, since she first joined in 2015, she has learned a lot from farming training, which has improved her day-to-day life significantly. Eunice will use the profits from this season to send her children to school.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 3.75 acres. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 5 solar lights.\"",
