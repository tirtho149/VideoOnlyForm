  "description": "Fernando is a weaver from Peru who specializes in alpaca apparel. He would like to invest in a bulk purchase of alpaca wool. Fernando has been selling through NOVICA since 2011. This is his story:<br /><br />\"My artistic origins come from my family. My uncles worked in textiles and little by little they introduced me to this world. I love being able to translate materials into beautiful designs. My work means everything to me: it's what I love and cherish, and I love the fact that I can provide for my family thanks to it.\"<br /><br />\"Many thanks for this tremendous support that you offer me. This microcredit will allow me to purchase a large amount of good quality wool and keep up a solid inventory of finished pieces.\"<br /><br />Use the link below to view Fernando's alpaca apparel on the NOVICA site:<br /><br />http://www.novica.com/kiva/7883",
