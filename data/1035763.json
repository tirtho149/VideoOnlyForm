  "description": "Naomi is a 25-year-old proud mother of 5 children. She is a group leader, often described as a very hardworking individual, and is representing her group of 15 farmers in Webuye District. Since joining One Acre Fund in 2014, Naomi has noticed that she has learnt a lot from farming trainings.<br /><br />Naomi described her harvest as good last year, but believes she can have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. She is very excited to also be purchasing a solar light, apart from fertilizer and maize, because she will now be able to have light during dark hours for her children to be able to study. With the profits from this season’s harvest, she plans to send her children to school.<br /><br />With this loan, Naomi’s Group will be able to plant a total of 7.5 acres of land and purchase a total of 12 solar lights.",
