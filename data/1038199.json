  "description": "Joseph is 57 years old and, as the group leader of his group, he is representing 15 farmers in Teso District. He is looking forward to be working with One Acre Fund for the first time this year, as this means he will have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods. <br /><br />Joseph has been a farmer for 20 years and is often described as a very hardworking individual. He decided to represent his group because he wanted to help more farmers. With the profits he earns from this coming season, Joseph would like to save more money for the future.<br /><br />Between the 15 farmers in Joseph’s Group, a total of 9.5 acres will be planted using the inputs from this loan. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light so, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 2 solar lights.",
