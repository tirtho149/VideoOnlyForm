  "description": "Mildred, pictured above, has been a farmer for 20 years, and is now proud to represent her group of 14 farmers in Webuye District. She is 50 years old, is married and has six children.<br /><br />Mildred likes to think of herself as a very experienced farmer. She has been working alongside One Acre Fund since 2013, and decided to represent her group because she wanted to help more farmers. She says that being part of the One Acre Fund community has meant that she has been able to consistently feed her family. Mildred plans to use the profits from this coming season to send her children to school.<br /><br />In total, Mildred’s Group will receive inputs to cultivate six acres of land. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of five solar lights.",
