  "description": "Khen is first from the right in the picture. He is a 53-year-old father of two dependent children, and he resides in the Prey Veng province, Cambodia. One of his children is a construction worker, while the other one is a student.  Khen has cultivated rice for more than thirty years. His wife is a 54-year-old rice farmer as well. Together, they can earn approximately $12 per day. <br /><br />Khen is a group leader and would like to request a loan as part of his group of three associates. He will use his portion to buy compost for farming. This loan helps him to grow his revenue and improve his family's standard of living. For his plans, he hopes that he can farm in both the dry and rainy seasons more than two times per year, save money to build a new house, and help his youngest child to earn a higher education.",
