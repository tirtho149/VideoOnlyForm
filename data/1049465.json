  "description": "Dorine is 45 years old and has 6 children. She has been a farmer for 20 years and is always said to be a very hardworking individual. Even though Dorine is the only one featured in the above picture, she is actually representing her group formed by 13 farmers in Webuye District, Kenya.<br /><br />Dorine started working alongside One Acre Fund a few years ago, in 2012, and decided to do so because she wanted to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods. Since then, she has seen her life improve; especially in the sense that she has been able to save more money ever since. This year she decided to represent her group because she wanted to spread the story of One Acre Fund farmers.<br /><br />Dorine’s Group will receive farming inputs to plant a total of 6.5 acres of land. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light so, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 3 solar lights.",
