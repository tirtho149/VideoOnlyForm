  "description": "Ana studied as far as the high school diploma and then got married. Her husband works in agriculture and as a bricklayer. Two of their children are currently in education while the oldest daughter is not dependent on their income and lives separately. <br /><br />Ana makes a living raising pigs and helps her husband with the cultivation. As well as this she makes bread at certain times of the year and goes out to sell it in the afternoons, since her husband has built her an oven. Her children help her with the productive activities she carries out.  <br /><br />She needs the loan to buy two pigs and concentrated feed for fattening them, and will also buy agricultural supplies for growing staple grains with her husband. <br /><br />Her dream is for her children to continue with their education and for her businesses to be more profitable so she can improve the living conditions for her family.",
