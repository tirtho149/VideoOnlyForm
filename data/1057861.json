  "description": "Parveen is a 55-year-old, married woman living in the area of Rawalpindi, Pakistan. She has requested a loan for her husband’s fruits selling business. Her husband sells seasonal fruit via a donkey cart; he purchases seasonal fruit in bulk and sells it from the cart. Since his practice is to sell seasonal fruits, now he wants to buy melon in a large quantity to sell because its season is going on and its price is very low.<br /><br />Therefore, Parveen requested a loan from Kiva’s field partner so that her husband can buy the melons in a large quantity. She hopes that this loan will prove productive for her, and that she will save a reasonable amount soon. <br /><br />Parveen is very thankful to the Kiva and its field partner BRAC Pakistan.",
