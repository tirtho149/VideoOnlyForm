  "description": "Rodah is 37 years old and lives with her husband in the Riobinchu, Kenyenya area of Kenya. She is blessed with four children who are her greatest motivators. She perseveres because she wants to provide a better future for them. <br /><br />Rodah was unable to study for a professional career because of the economic situation in her family. However, she never gave up and has been practicing farming for the past 10 years. <br /><br />Rodah has always had an affinity for farming. She has even nicknamed one of her cows and is a very proud farmer, especially when she is milking her cows. Her cows produce between 10-15 liters of milk a day, which helps her support her family. <br /><br />She also practices crop farming, but she has not been making good profits because of poor farming inputs. That is why Rodah is seeking a loan to buy farm inputs. Through this loan, she will be able to purchase high-quality seed, good fertilizer, and pesticides that she will use to greatly improve her crop production. <br /><br />Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques, and high-quality seeds will assure her of a bumper harvest and increased profits. Rodah is very visionary, and her goal for the season is to boost her crop production over the previous year's yield. All this can be achieved through lenders' help and goodwill. <br /><br />Rodah believes that through this loan, she will be able to give her children a solid education and that the loan will lift her out of poverty. Make a $25 loan or more, and push Rodah’s dream closer to reality.",
