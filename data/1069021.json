  "Name": "Flor De Maguey 2 Group",
  "description": "My name is Juana. I´m 58 years old and I have four children. When I was a child, my parents said that we had to hide from the teachers. They told me that the teachers went to the houses to take the children to school. I hid and I never went to school.<br /><br />When I was 15, I joined my husband. I have had to work on farms so my children could study. Now two of my four children have already graduated as elementary education teachers. Both of them are working and helping me with our expenses.<br /><br />This year I will receive my fourth credit. I have been using my credits to make elaborate güipiles (traditional tops) which I sell at the market. I also sow maize, and now I am also selling maize at the market. The credits lent to me by the Chajulense Association of Women United for Life have helped to pay for my children's education and to give them better nutrition. This year I will use the credit to buy thread and to sow maize.<br /><br />I am the leader of the Flor de Maguey 2 Group which comprises seven women, all from the Ixil Maya ethnicity. The group members will use their loans as follows: for agriculture 29%; textiles 29%; manufacturing 14%; retail 14%; and services 14%. On average, each member of the group has four children. Among the group members, the average age is 38; 43% are illiterate; 43% did not complete their primary education; and 14% are elementary education teachers. The average amount of each member's loan is GTQ 3,371.",
