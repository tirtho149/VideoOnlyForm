From the milk they get she makes dairy products that go to neighbors and relatives. <br /><br />Heghine wants to build up her farm and be able to produce more. She has applied for a 1,000,000 AMD loan through Kiva's field partner SEF to buy three sows plus forage to feed the livestock. She offers her thanks in advance for your understanding and help.",
