  "description": "This group consists of 5 VLG (Village Lending Group) members, who help to operate the loan program smoothly in the area. Pictured are Maw, Han, Thaung, Wah, and Hla and Maw (1st from the left) is the featured borrower of the group. The 47-year-old, Maw is married with five daughters, who are now in Grade 1, Grade 3, and Grade 6 respectively. She earns her living by farming, raising livestock, and selling groceries. Maw's first priority is to raise her daughters to become well-educated. She is a both hard-working and very strong lady who is also taken as 'leader' of the family.Maw enjoys reading various books in her spare time and wants her daughters to also spend their time reading and be well-educated. <br>\nShe has been working on her farm which has been operating since her ancestors’ time. The biggest challenge for her in agriculture is water shortages that make her plants grow very slowly. She wants to use Proximity's new loan to buy crop seeds, such as maize, peanut, and sesame. With the funds from Kiva, she will also pay to day laborers and purchase fertilizers. She is willing and also very excited to get the loan as soon as possible because she believes that the more she invests, the more profit she gets. This profit will improve her family’s livelihood and contribute to education costs for her daughters.",
