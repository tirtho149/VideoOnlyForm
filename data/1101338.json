Gayane has been into farming for seven years and, together with her husband, looks after 40 beehives. <br /><br />Gayane decided to try her hand at animal-keeping and now owns several cows and calves. She provides her family's day to day living, thanks to beekeeping and honey realization, sold in the local markets and among neighbors. Gayane, with the help of  her husband, takes care of her daughter and parents-in-law, aged between 80 and 84 years. <br /><br />Gayane needs this Kiva support to pay for ten beehives and buy beekeeping supplies to develop her farm. This will help her to earn more money and further develop her farming processes. <br /><br />Gayane hopes for your help and understanding. She is looking forward to your warm response.",
