  "Name": "African Chicken",
  "description": "African Chicken is tackling the issues of poverty, hunger, and unemployment through chicken. It does this by partnering with rural women farmers in Tanzania, supplying them (for free) with baby chicks, chicken feed, training, and veterinarian support.\n\nOnce the chicks are fully grown, African Chicken purchases 90% of the chickens from the farmers, and distributes them to retailers, hotels, and restaurants in Dar es Salaam, the largest city in Tanzania. 10% of the chickens are purposefully left with the women to feed their families. In its first six months of operations, African Chicken has supplied chicks to 64 women and they have raised 12,000 chickens.\n\nThis loan will grow the supply of chicks and feed to supply the next 176 women who have signed up to be production partners.\n\nLearn more about African Chicken here: http://www.africanchickenltd.com/",
