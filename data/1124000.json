  "description": "Irene is a 46-year-old woman who lives with her partner. She has a 20-year-old son and a 13-year-old daughter. Her occupation is fishing and she works in the community called \"Chua Chocani\" which is located on the banks of Lake Titicaca.<br /><br />Irene works together with her life partner and with her children who attend school. They live in their own house which is built of adobe and has electricity. They get up very early in the morning to go out in their boat and place their nets which they bring in several hours later. The fish that are found in the area include trout, mauri, pejerrey, boga, ispi and others. \"We have regular customers who buy all our fish...\" she states. Her business is successful because there is great demand for fish.<br /><br />The advantage of her work is that the whole family takes turns in performing the fishing tasks, but the disadvantage is that there are not enough nets because they are always getting damaged. <br /><br />Her dream is to increase her income so she would like to buy wholesale fishing nets.<br /><br />This is her first loan sequence with the institution in the 20 years she has been fishing. These are the reasons why Irene is applying for a loan - to buy wholesale fishing nets to work alongside her family.",
