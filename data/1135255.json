  "description": "Quan, 50, is a Thai ethic woman who lives with her husband, her son, her daughter, her daughter-in-law and 2 grandchildren at a Thai traditional stilt house in a remote area. Because they are a large family, they work hard to cover living expenses and improve their living conditions. The family works hard in plenty of jobs such as growing rice and coffee and raising pigs, chickens and ducks. This is the sixth time she has taken a loan from the Anh Chi Em program to buy fertilizers for a coffee field. She said that her family invests a lot of money in the coffee field, so she hopes that her coffee field will bring a great profit for her family in the months after harvesting. Quan dreams her beloved family will have an abundant life and develop the family's farm. In the picture, she stands first from the right.\r\n",
