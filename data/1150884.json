  "description": "<p>Marina is passionate about the rainforest and the people, plants and animals that live there. Between May 2000 and August 2006, Brazil lost nearly 150,000 square kilometres of forest, an area larger than Greece. Growing up in the Amazon, Marina saw first hand the impact human activity had on the forest and was determined to work to reverse its negative effects.</p>\n\n<p>Marina started <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1CjVDL_Dq0&feature=youtu.be\">Assobio</a> , a Social Business that aims to tackle deforestation through commercial plantation programs, run on behalf of businesses required under environmental laws to replace any forest they use. Assobio also provides training and education on the proper stewardship of native rainforest and offers employment opportunities through its reforestation programs to the most disadvantaged members of local communities.</p>\n\n<p>Marina and Geysa, the founders of Assobio, believe that “Things can’t go on this way anymore. If we want future generations to remain and thrive in Brazil's rainforests, we need to change our habits and attitudes. To us, changing the world means achieving a balance between humans and the environment.” This Kiva loan will be invested in new offices for the company that double as a nursery for rare and endangered rainforest forest plant species, essential for Assobio’s expansion and impact generation.</p>\n\n",
