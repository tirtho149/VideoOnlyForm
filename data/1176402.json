  "description": "Eduard lives in the town of El Faique with his wife. He is 27 years old. Eduard works in a variety of areas, be it providing harvesting and drying services of coffee, with the support of his wife, Olga, who also works as a farmer, or making some extra income raising small farm animals for private consumption. Eduard needs to keep composting and growing more coffee plants in the town of El Faique – San José de Lourdes and he hopes one day he can use the earning to fix his home and improve his family's living conditions.<br />This loan will allow Eduard to have the chance to increase his coffee production in his farm, not only ensuring he will have a job, but also giving him the chance to plan for the growth of his family and to live in better financial conditions some day as well.",
