She is 42 years old, is married and has seven children.<br /><br />Joyce likes to think of herself as a very trustworthy person. She has been working alongside One Acre Fund since 2013 and decided to represent her group because she likes being a leader.

Joyce plans to use the profits from this coming season to buy a cow.<br /><br />In total, Joyce’s Group will receive inputs to cultivate six acres of land.
