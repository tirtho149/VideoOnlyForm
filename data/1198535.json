  "description": "Mactilda, age 35, is a proud mother of five children.  She is a group leader who is often described as a very experienced farmer.  Mactilda is representing her group of 16 farmers from Teso District.  Since joining One Acre Fund in 2013, she has noticed that she has gained a lot of respect in her community.  <br /><br />Mactilda describes her harvest from last year as good, but she believes she can have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  She is very excited about purchasing a solar light, in addition to fertilizer and maize, because she will now be able to have light during the dark hours so that her children can study.  With the profits from this season’s harvest, she plans to send her children to school.  <br /><br />With this loan, Mactilda’s group will be able to plant a total of 10.25 acres of land and purchase a total of 11 solar lights.",
