  "Name": "Bethany's Group",
  "description": "Bethany is fifty-eight years old and has seven children. He is a group leader and is representing his group formed by fourteen farmers in Webuye District, Kenya. <br /><br />Bethany has been farming with One Acre Fund for years now, having joined the program for the first time in 2008. This decision was largely as a result of his desire to have access to quality training and to acquire new farming methods. Although he described his last harvest as poor due to bad weather conditions, he believes he could have a better one this year by continuing to work alongside One Acre Fund. Bethany also decided to purchase a solar light as part of his loan, which he is very excited about, as it will allow him to have light during dark hours for his children to be able to study.<br /><br />Obtaining this loan means that Bethany's Group will be able to receive a total of fourteen solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of seven acres.",
