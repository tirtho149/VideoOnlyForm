  "Name": "Norah's Group",
  "description": "Norah is 30 years old and is often described as a very resourceful person. As a group leader, Norah is representing her group of 11 farmers in Webuye District in Kenya. She is excited to be joining One Acre Fund for the first time this year.<br /><br />The decision to join One Acre Fund was largely a result of Norah's desire to earn enough to feed her family. Apart from receiving farming inputs, she is also purchasing a solar light as part of her loan, which is very exciting to her as she will now be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money. With the profits that she gains from this year’s harvest, she plans to buy a cow.<br /><br />Norah and her group will receive a total of 10 solar lights as well as input loans of maize and fertilizer to plant a total of 3.75 acres.",
