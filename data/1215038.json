  "Name": "Margaret's Group",
  "description": "Margaret  is 56 years old and has 7 children. She is a group leader and is representing her group formed by 10 farmers in Teso District, Kenya. \n\nMargaret  has been farming with One Acre Fund for years now, having joined the program for the first time in 2012. This decision was largely a result of her desire to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods and, although she described her last harvest as poor due to bad weather conditions, she believes she could have a better one this year by continuing to work alongside One Acre Fund. Margaret  also decided to purchase a solar light as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to have an overall improved quality of life.\n\nObtaining this loan means that Margaret 's Group will be able to receive a total of 6 solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 4.25 acres.",
