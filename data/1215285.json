  "Name": "Phanice's Group",
  "description": "Phanice, pictured above, is a group leader and is representing her group, formed by 9 farmers in Webuye District, Kenya. She joined One Acre Fund for the first time in 2011 and decided to represent her group because she wanted to be more active in her community. She is married and has 4 children.<br /><br />With a portion of this loan, Phanice will not only purchase maize seeds and fertilizer for the coming harvesting season, but also a solar light. Receiving a solar light as part of her loan means that now she will be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money. Phanice plans to use the profits she gains this year to send her children to school.<br /><br />In total Phanice’s Group will use the inputs received from this loan to plant a total of 4.5 acres of land. They will also receive a total of 11 solar lights.",
