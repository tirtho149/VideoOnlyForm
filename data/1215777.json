  "Name": "Jemimah's Group",
  "description": "Jemimah is 36 years old and has 6 children. She is a group leader and is representing her group formed by 13 farmers in Teso District, Kenya. <br /><br />Jemimah has been farming with One Acre Fund for years now, having joined the program for the first time in 2012. This decision was largely a result of her desire to get the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds and, although she described her last harvest as good, she believes she could have a better one this year by continuing to work alongside One Acre Fund. Jemimah also decided to purchase a solar light as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to have an overall improved quality of life.<br /><br />Obtaining this loan means that Jemimah's Group will be able to receive a total of 9 solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 8.25 acres.",
