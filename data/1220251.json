  "description": "Manita is one of the leaders helping the rural population of Jeremie. Her location is pinned as a place where the relative poverty is severe in the aftermath of the hurricane. That's why she created a savings group with 24 females and 1 male. Her group has allowed members to socialize and show solidarity among themselves in case of funerals or sickness. <br /><br />Today, Manita would like to find a loan to help members buy farming supplies to plant.
