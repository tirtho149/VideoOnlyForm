  "description": "Joseph is a 65-year-old proud father of 6 children. He is a group leader, often described as a very trustworthy person, and is representing his group of 11 farmers in Kimilili District. Since joining One Acre Fund in 2013, Joseph has noticed that he has been able to consistently feed his family.\n\nJoseph described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. He is very excited to also be purchasing a solar light, apart from fertilizer and maize, because he will now be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money. With the profits from this season’s harvest, he plans to send his children to school.\n\nWith this loan, Joseph’s Group will be able to plant a total of 7 acres of land and purchase a total of 6 solar lights.",
