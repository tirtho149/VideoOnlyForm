Sammy has been a farmer for five years and is often referred to as a very hardworking individual.<br /><br />Sammy isn’t new to One Acre Fund; he actually joined the program in 2015 and has since noticed his life has changed, especially in the sense that he has been able to save more money ever since. <br /><br />This year, Sammy will not only get fertilizer and maize seeds as part of his loan, but will also purchase a solar light. He is very excited about this addition since now he will be able to have light during the night in order to feel safer.<br /><br />Using this loan, Sammy's Group will purchase a total of eight solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of 8.75 acres.",
