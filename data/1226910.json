  "Name": "Philip's Group",
  "description": "Philip, pictured above, is a group leader and is representing his group, formed by 6 farmers in Matete District, Kenya.  He joined One Acre Fund for the first time in 2011 and decided to represent his group because he wanted to spread the story of farmers.  He is married and has 4 children.<br /><br />With a portion of this loan, Philip will not only purchase maize seeds and fertilizer for the coming harvest season, but also two solar lights.  Receiving two solar lights as part of his loan means that now he will be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.  Philip plans to use the profits he gains this year to repair his home.<br /><br />In total Philip’s Group will use the inputs received from this loan to plant a total of 4.75 acres of land. They will also receive a total of 4 solar lights.",
