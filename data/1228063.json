  "Name": "Patrick's Group",
  "description": "Patrick is 50 years old and has 10 children. He has been a farmer for 10 years and is always said to be a very reliable person. Even though Patrick is the only one featured in the above picture, he is actually representing his group composed of 14 farmers in Chwele District, Kenya.<br /><br />Patrick started working alongside One Acre Fund a few years ago, in 2009, and decided to do so because he wanted to earn enough to feed his family. Since then, he has seen his life improve; especially in the sense that he has been able to consistently feed his family ever since. This year he decided to represent his group because he likes being a leader.<br /><br />Patrick’s Group will receive farming inputs to plant a total of 10 acres of land. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light, so with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 8 solar lights.",
