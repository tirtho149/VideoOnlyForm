  "Name": "Gladys' Group",
  "description": "Gladys is a 40-year-old woman with seven children. She is a group leader and is representing her group formed by seven farmers in the Matete District, Kenya. <br /><br />Gladys has been farming with One Acre Fund for years, having joined the program for the first time in 2010. This decision was largely a result of her desire to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods. Although she described her last harvest as good, she believes she could have a better one this year by continuing to work alongside One Acre Fund. Gladys also decided to purchase a solar light with part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to have light during dark hours for her children to be able to study.<br /><br />Obtaining this loan means that Gladys 's Group will be able to receive a total of two solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of six acres.",
