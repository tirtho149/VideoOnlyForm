  "Name": "Julia's Group",
  "description": "Julia, pictured above, is a group leader and is representing her group, formed by nine farmers in Matete District, Kenya. She joined One Acre Fund for the first time in 2010 and decided to represent her group because she likes being a leader. She is married and has three children.<br /><br />With a portion of this loan, Julia will not only purchase maize seeds and fertilizer for the coming harvesting season, but also a solar light. Receiving a solar light as part of her loan means that now she will be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money. Julia plans to use the profits she gains this year to send her children to school.<br /><br />In total Julia’s Group will use the inputs received from this loan to plant a total of six acres of land. They will also receive a total of six solar lights.",
