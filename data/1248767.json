  "description": "Violet is a 39-year-old proud mother of 5 children. She is a group leader, often described as a very experienced farmer, and is representing her group of 8 farmers in Webuye District. Since joining One Acre Fund in 2015, Violet has noticed that she has been able to consistently feed her family.\n\nViolet described her harvest as poor due to bad weather conditions last year, but believes she can have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. She is very excited to also be purchasing a solar light, apart from fertilizer and maize, because she will now be able to have light during dark hours for her children to be able to study. With the profits from this season’s harvest, she plans to send her children to school.\n\nWith this loan, Violet’s group will be able to plant a total of 1.5 acres of land and purchase a total of 10 solar lights.",
