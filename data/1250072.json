  "Name": "Florence's Group",
  "description": "Florence is 63 years old and has 10 children. She is a group leader and is representing her group formed by 12 farmers in Webuye District, Kenya. <br /><br />Florence has been farming with One Acre Fund for years now, having joined the program for the first time in 2010. This decision was largely a result of her desire to earn enough to feed her family. And although she described her last harvest as good, she believes she could have a better one this year by continuing to work alongside One Acre Fund. Florence also decided to purchase a solar light as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to have an overall improved quality of life.<br /><br />Obtaining this loan means that Florence's group will be able to receive a total of 11 solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 7.25 acres.",
