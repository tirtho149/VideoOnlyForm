  "Name": "Madam Sally's Group",
  "description": "Sally K (\"Madam Sally\", 4th from left) lost her food trading business during the Country's recent Ebola Crisis and is struggling to support a large extended family while ensuring her children and grandchildren get a good education. A respected leader and trader in Makeni, \"Madam Sally\" has lovingly mentored unemployed women in trading and created a strong group of hard working, responsible women who are ready for this KIVA loan. Many of the group members had trading businesses before the Ebola Crisis and maintain a connection with past customers. All are united in their desire to restart and rebuild. A KIVA loan will enable this exceptional, hard-working group of women to get back on their feet and back to business. \n\nMadam Sally's group is also committed to buying locally produced, rather than imported, rice to support local farmers. The group’s KIVA loan will therefore be used to purchase organic, locally produced rice which will increase employment and food access in the suburbs of Makeni.\n",
