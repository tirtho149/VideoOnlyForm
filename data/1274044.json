  "description": "Trish Naudon was a Cali-girl—a Santa Monica, surf-before-high school kinda kid. She is of Mexican decent and grew up learning about botanical healing from her grandmother. Abuelita would walk Trish through her copious herbal gardens and explain the plants to her at a very young age. Trish watched how ingredients were prepared and used to address common conditions and symptoms. She eventually made her way to the east coast and eventually ended up in NYC where she met me, Chris Thomas while working for Bertelsmann’s Digital World Services, the company that rebuilt Napster after it was initially taken offline. \r\nI was raised on Long Island. My family purchased 72 acres of remote land in Vermont in the 1970s and I spent my summers wandering the woods and interacting with nature. Despite Trish and I having been immersed in the hectic, urban, digital world that is New York City, we were nature-lovers, drawn to plants and natural purity. \r\nIt wasn’t easy, but we did it. In 2010, while 8 months pregnant, Trish and I and our two cats made the move to Brookline, VT. It was a big life change and we were thrilled with it. We moved into a beautiful, brand new construction rental property next to a CSA farm, got chickens, and began growing everything we could—vegetables, fruits, and herbs. Our daughter Myla Sol was born soon after we arrived. In 2014 the home next door to my mother’s home became available and we sprang at the chance. We are now finalizing construction of a 1,000 sq. ft. workspace and getting ready to begin cultivation of three acres of prime growing land. Our dream is to become a true “Farm to Jar” operation, being responsible for all stages of our plants lifespan from seed to our jars.",
