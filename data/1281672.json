  "description": "Eliud, pictured above, has been a farmer for 10 years, and he is now proud to represent his group of 16 farmers in Teso District. He is 46 years old, is married, and has 8 children.<br /><br />Eliud likes to think of himself as a very hard-working individual. He has been working alongside One Acre Fund since 2016 and decided to represent his group because he wanted to help more farmers. <br /><br />He says that being part of the One Acre Fund community has meant that he has been able to consistently feed his family. Eliud plans to use the profits from this coming season to buy a cow.<br /><br />In total, Eliud’s group will receive inputs to cultivate 14.5 acres of land. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 8 solar lights.",
