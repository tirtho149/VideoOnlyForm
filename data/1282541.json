  "description": "Ben's Group is formed by 13 farmers in Matete District and is being represented by Ben, who is the group leader pictured above. He is 35 years old, is married and has three children. Ben has been a farmer for more than 20 years and is often referred to as a very hardworking individual.<br /><br />Ben isn’t new to One Acre Fund; he actually joined the program in 2014 and has since noticed his life has changed, especially in the sense that he has been able to consistently feed his family ever since. <br /><br />This year, Ben will not only get fertilizer and maize seeds as part of his loan, but he will also purchase a solar light. He is very excited about this addition since now he will be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel, and therefore, save more money.<br /><br />Using this loan, Ben's Group will purchase a total of nine solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of 6.5 acres.",
