  "description": "Andrez appears in the photo with his two-year-old son.  He is 43 years old and has been a coffee grower for four years.  Andrez has a farm that includes 1.4 hectares of land, 0.7 of which is used for growing coffee.  He manages his land using the Fair Trade criteria and following best farming practices.  In addition to producing coffee, some of his land is set aside for cultivating basic grains, citrus fruits, and bananas.  These crops enable him to maintain a diversified farm.  <br /><br />For this crop cycle, Andrez is requesting a loan in order to purchase bio-supplies to maintain his coffee and guarantee the nutrition of his coffee plants.  He is always protecting the flora and fauna that surround his small farm.  His goal is to have a better harvest this year so that he can generate more income to provide his family with better conditions.",
