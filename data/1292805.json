  "description": "My name is Stephanie Westhelle, CEO of The Forgotten Fruit, social entrepreneur, and seeker of funding to make my dreams a reality. \r\n\r\nIn the early years of my career, I worked in various facets of the hospitality industry, received several awards, and thought I had my career path figured out. However, after years of feeling there was a social piece missing to my work, I asked myself a simple question. What initiatives were being implemented by the hospitality industry to aid in positive social, environmental, and economic change? The answer was not much. This realization instigated the decision to leave hotel management, and start pursuing a career in sustainable development.\r\n\r\nI began the next phase of my career, when I joined the team at Theo Chocolate. I was a spokesperson tasked with engaging consumers and clients on the importance of fair trade policies, good environmental practices, and the value of a socially driven mission. The skills acquired from working with a social enterprise, ignited a fire within to bring more sustainable practices to companies throughout the globe.\r\n\r\nThis passion led me to pursue a degree from George Washington University, researching food distribution systems and sustainability efforts in tourism. From this research, I began learning the errors within the United States agricultural system, and knew I wanted to create a company to start fixing some of America’s food waste issues.\r\n\r\nIt took almost fifteen years to figure out my dream job would need to be created. I know I have the zeal and drive to successfully run The Forgotten Fruit; I just don’t have the funds to start the next part of my career path. I hope you consider funding part of my business loan, as I rally up a mini army, to fight against food waste!",
