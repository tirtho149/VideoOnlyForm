  "description": "Orcar is 40 years old. He is a coffee grower from northern Nicaragua. He has a small farm of 1.75 hectares, with coffee growing on 0.7 hectares, which he has been working the last 3 years.<br /> <br />In the previous cycle, he obtained his first harvest, so this year he has decided to implement a maintenance plan to help improve the nutritional condition of his coffee farm. To do this he is requesting a loan to buy agricultural supplies to achieve a better harvest and better income. <br /><br />For this producer, the greatest legacy he can leave, is the love of work and coffee, a crop his family has been dedicated to for many generations, and which he now manages under criteria of fair trade certification.",
