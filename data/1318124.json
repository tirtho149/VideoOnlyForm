  "description": "The “Microcredit Plus” program of Friendship Bridge provides small loans, education & women’s preventative health services that help the 9 Maya Kaqchikel women in the Trust Bank “Las Estrellas Santiago” in Sacatepequez increase their income, empower themselves, & raise their standard of living. The ladies have various businesses that include vegetable farming, bakeries, traditional handicrafts, & textile production. They are on their 1st loan cycle with KIVA. <br /><br />Marta, a 24 year old single woman with a 6th grade education, is the Secretary of the group. She works with her family growing zucchini squash & also has a business of weaving colorful traditional blouses called “huipiles”. At this time of the year, she is working hard on the farm to plant her new crop, but she also needs to inject capital into her textile business. <br /><br />Marta is requesting a loan to buy a variety of high quality threads for her textiles and to buy fertilizer & seeds for the farm. Her goals are to see her businesses prosper, by taking her textiles and produce to other markets, both inside & outside of Guatemala. <br /><br />These ladies have an average of 2.6 years of formal education but on a monthly basis, they learn practical, applicable lessons on topics that range from business practices to health & self esteem. The curriculum is responsive to their needs & covers an aspect of 4 main topics: business, health, family, women.<br /><br />Thank you, Kiva lenders, for your generosity in funding these much needed loans!",
