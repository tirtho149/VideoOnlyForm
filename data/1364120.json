  "description": "Ephraim appreciates Kiva lenders for the support toward his previous loan, which helped to boost his yield and also yielded higher income to ably meet his financial obligations. <br /><br />Once more he would like another loan of 2,000,000 UGX to help him buy manure and mulch to help spread in his coffee garden. This will help to keep away the weeds and pests, and therefore, further boost the yield and increase the sales.<br /><br />This will help him overcome the challenge of limited capital and changes in weather conditions that affect his yields.<br /><br />He is honest and hardworking, and he appreciates UGAFODE for the good services being rendered to its clients, especially farmers.",
