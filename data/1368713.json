  "Name": "Poreh's Lady Farmer Group",
  "description": "Poreh M (1st from the right) is a dedicated mother, wife and grandmother. She is a farming legend in Morimaraia Village, having achieved exceptional yields while doing her best to encourage other women to farm. In her words \"Farming is better than trading or moving to the city. Farming teaches us to take care of each other and take care of our land.\" <br /><br />Poreh has organized a special group of \"Lady Farmers\" who are extremely hard working but lost their farms during Sierra Leone's recent Ebola crisis. Quarantines and increased costs devastated these women's livelihoods and all members are currently trapped in a cycle of subsistence and forced to take extremely high-interest loans for poor quality inputs during planting time. A low interest Kiva loan will enable this group of determined women to get back on their feet and back in business.",
