  "description": "I was born in Michigan in 1970.  I grew up in a small town, surrounded by farms. My aunt and uncle had a hobby farm outside of town, and I always loved visiting the animals.  I can’t really remember how old I was, but I was probably in 4th grade or so, when I bought baby chicks at the feed mill and set them up in our basement. I actually thought my parents wouldn’t notice!  My mom made me give them all away, and fortunately the science teachers at the middle school had a small farm and took them in.  Fast forward to 20-some years later, my ex-husband and I bought a place in the country.  I immediately got some chickens.  And then some more.  And then some ducks, and some turkeys.  The one thing he absolutely refused to agree to was a goat.  I named her Penny.  He grew to love her.\r\nWhen my ex and I bought the farm, and I started raising chickens, I realized that I might be able to earn a living doing something I loved.  Prior to nursing school, I had gone to cooking school.  I apprenticed at The Worthington Inn, and worked in the kitchens of several fine-dining establishments in Columbus.  While I realized that restaurant work wasn’t for me, I never lost my appreciation for good food and fine ingredients.  As I learned more about healthy foods, the organic movement, and the impact of diet on disease, I wanted to grow more of the food that I was feeding my family.  Now I feed my community. \r\nMy son and I work together everyday.  I look forward to opening this shop with him, so that we will be able to continue to work together into the future.",
