  "description": "Victoria is 41 years old. She is married. She has four school-aged children. Her business is selling spring onions. Her work is done in ‘El torno’, a rural area that supplies the city with all of its agricultural production.<br />Victoria lives in her own home with her family. Her work is selling spring onions which is a variety native to the area. They have a small size and a strong and sweet flavor. They are in high demand for national cooking. <br />The work is done by purchasing wholesale items directly from the producers and selling them at the community vegetable market. The productive cycle of this variety of onions lasts for nine months and at this time, the crop has the best price. The advantage is that this product is very in demand. The disadvantage is that the crop must be sold now because the climate of the area spoils it. Her dream is to rent land to grow parsley and spring onions. She wants to buy wholesale spring onions. With this loan, she will buy wholesale spring onions. This is her first loan with the institution in the three years she has dedicated to this business. <br />It is for this reason that Victoria is requesting a loan to purchase spring onions to take advantage of the increase in price and obtain better revenue for the sale.",
