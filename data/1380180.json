  "description": "Pictured above is Jeritha, often described as an extremely hardworking individual. She is 38 years old and has 6 children. As a group leader, she is representing her group of 6 farmers in Kilolo North District, Tanzania. <br /><br />Jeritha is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again as this means that she is able to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods, which is why she decided to join in the first place. Jeritha says that she is happy to have made that decision because, since she first joined in 2015, she has been able to consistently feed her family, which has improved her day-to-day life significantly. Jeritha will use the profits from this season to repair her home.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 7 acres. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 1 solar light.",
