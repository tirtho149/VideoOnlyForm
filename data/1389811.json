She has been working alongside One Acre Fund since 2015 and decided to represent her group because she likes being a leader.

Ana plans to use the profits from this coming season to buy a goat.<br /><br />In total, Ana’s Group will receive inputs to cultivate 14.5 acres of land. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 7 solar lights.",
