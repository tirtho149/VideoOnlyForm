  "description": "Kalameli is a 52-year-old, married woman with four children. She runs a business of selling vegetables (cabbage and cucumbers) in her community to earn a living. She has three years of experience with this business. Kalameli is a Samoan citizen, and she works very hard to satisfy her customers with her fresh vegetables. Everyday, she travels to the market by bus to sell her fresh vegetables. Kalameli needs a loan to purchase more equipment (a water tank, chemicals, vegetable seeds, soil, and a rake) to help take her business to the next level. <br /><br />Her dream is that one day she will earn more to buy her own vehicle to help her run the business, and send her children to school. She became a member of SPBD in 2015.",
