  "Name": "Shadrack's Group",
  "description": "This season is not the first one that Shadrack is working alongside One Acre Fund. He has been a member for a few years now, having joined the program in 2015 and, although he is the only person featured in the above picture, he is actually representing his group of nine farmers in Kilolo North District, Tanzania.<br /><br />Shadrack is often described by his community as a very hardworking  individual and decided to be the one to represent his group because he likes being a leader. Like many of his fellow farmers, Shadrack decided he wanted to be part of the One Acre Fund community in order to have access to quality training and  acquire new farming methods. He hopes to use the profits from this year’s harvest to buy a cow.<br /><br />This loan will not only help Shadrack but the whole group, who will receive maize seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 12 acres of land. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light so, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of four solar lights.",
