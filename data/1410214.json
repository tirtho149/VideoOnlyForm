  "description": "Luwonekage is the group leader of his group in Kilolo North District, and he is representing 8 farmers, including himself. Luwonekage joined One Acre Fund for the first time this season, but he has been a farmer for more than 20 years.<br /><br />Like many other farmers, Luwonekage decided to work with One Acre Fund in order to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods. He hopes that by joining One Acre Fund and using the seeds and fertilizer he will get with this loan, he can join the ranks of One Acre Fund farmers that have doubled their harvest in their first year of the program. <br /><br />He plans to use the profits he earns from this year’s harvest to repair his home.<br /><br />Luwonekage's Group will use the farming inputs received with this loan to cultivate a total of 6.5 acres of land. They will also receive a total of 1 solar light, as, even though Luwonekage decided not to, one farmer in the group will be purchasing a solar light as part of the loan package.",
