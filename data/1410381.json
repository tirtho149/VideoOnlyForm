Atilio has been a farmer for more than 20 years and is often referred to as a very hardworking individual.<br /><br />Atilio isn’t new to One Acre Fund, he actually joined the program in 2015 and has since noticed his life has changed; especially in the sense that he has been able to consistently feed his family ever since. This year, Atilio will not only get fertilizer and maize seeds as part of his loan, but will also purchase a solar light. He is very excited about this addition since now he will be able to have light during dark hours for his children to be able to study.<br /><br />Using this loan, Atilio's Group will purchase a total of five solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of 11.5 acres.",
