  "description": "Ronaldo is 19 years old.  He is single and his business is trading cattle.  He works in the 'Batallas' rural area located on the shores of the sacred Lake Titicaca.<br /><br />Ronaldo lives with his parents who have given him land to work and become independent.  His work is raising cattle which he buys to fatten over a period of 3 to 4 months and then sells them to merchants or butchers.  He has a barn next to his house and land intended for grazing.  The sale is made at two local fairs.  To improve his business, he needs to raise livestock continuously. <br /><br />His second activity is building. The advantage is that he has continuous customers, the problem is buying livestock.  His dream is to expand his barn in an aim to have more cattle for fattening. With this loan, he will buy one head of cattle to fatten.  It is the first loan he receives from the institution in the five years that performs this activity.<br /><br />It is for these reasons that Ronaldo requests a loan to buy livestock to fatten and sell at a better price to become independent.",
