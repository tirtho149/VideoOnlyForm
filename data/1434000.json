  "description": "Violet's Group is formed by eight farmers in Matete District and is being represented by Violet, who is the group leader pictured above. <br /><br />Violet is 42 years old and has nine children. Violet has been a farmer for 16 years and is often referred to as a very hardworking individual.<br /><br />Violet isn’t new to One Acre Fund, she actually joined the program in 2014 and has since noticed her life has changed; especially in the sense that she has been able to consistently feed her family ever since. <br /><br />This year, Violet will not only get fertilizer and maize seeds as part of her loan, but will also purchase a solar light. She is very excited about this addition since she will now be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and, therefore, save more money.<br /><br />Using this loan, Violet's Group will purchase a total of 4 solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of 5.75 acres.",
