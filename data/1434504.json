  "description": "Mary, pictured above, has been a farmer for more than 20 years, and is now proud to represent her group of 14 farmers in Webuye District. She is 43 years old, married and has 3 children.<br /><br />Mary likes to think of herself as a very hardworking individual. She has been working alongside One Acre Fund since 2015 and decided to represent her group because she wanted to spread the story of One Acre Fund farmers. She says that being part of the One Acre Fund community has meant that she has been able to consistently feed her family. Mary plans to use the profits from this coming season to send her children to school.<br /><br />In total, Mary’s Group will receive inputs to cultivate 10.25 acres of land. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, the group will also receive a total of 7 solar lights with this loan.",
