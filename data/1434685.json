  "description": "Joan, pictured above, has been a farmer for more than 20 years, and is now proud to represent her group of eight farmers in Webuye District. Joan is 47 years old, married and has four children.<br /><br />Joan likes to think of herself as a very reliable person. She has been working alongside One Acre Fund since 2016 and decided to represent her group because she wanted to spread the story of One Acre Fund farmers. She says that being part of the One Acre Fund community has meant that she has been able to consistently feed her family. Joan plans to use the profits from this coming season to send her children to school.<br /><br />In total, Joan’s Group will receive inputs to cultivate 4.5 acres of land. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of five solar lights.",
