  "description": "Leah is 35 years old and is often referred to as a really hardworking individual. As a group leader, she is representing her group in Teso District, formed by 15 farmers, including herself.<br /><br />Leah has been a farmer for 15 years, and has worked with One Acre Fund for a while now, having joined for the first time in 2016 because she wanted to earn enough to feed her family. Not only will she get maize seeds and fertilizer with her loan, but also a solar light in order to have light during dark hours for her children to be able to study. She decided that she will use the profits she gains from this year’s harvest to buy a cow.<br /><br />With this loan, Leah’s Group will receive a total of 11 solar lights as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 8.25 acres.",
