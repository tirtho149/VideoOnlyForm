  "description": "Pictured above is Pamela, who, as a group leader, is representing her group formed by 14 farmers in Sirisia District, Kenya. She is a mother to 7 children and is known by her community as a very reliable person.<br /><br />Initially, Pamela joined One Acre Fund in 2008 because she wanted to earn enough to feed her family. Since she joined the program she says that her life has improved, especially because she has had more profits from each harvest. With the profits from the coming harvesting season, Pamela plans to send her children to school.<br /><br />Between the 14 farmers in Pamela's Group, a total of 12.75 acres of land will be planted using the maize seeds and fertilizer received with the loan. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light so, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 5 solar lights.",
