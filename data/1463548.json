  "description": "Pictured above is David, often described as an extremely trustworthy person. He is 50 years old and has 6 children. As a group leader, he is representing his group of seven farmers in Teso district, Kenya. <br /><br />David is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again, as this means that he is able to earn enough to feed his family, which is why he decided to join in the first place. David says that he is happy to have made that decision because, since he first joined in 2013, he has been able to consistently feed his family, which has improved his day-to-day life significantly. He will use the profits from this season to send his children to school.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of five acres. Given that a member of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, with this loan, the group will also receive one solar light.",
