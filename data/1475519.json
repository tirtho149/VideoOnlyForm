She is a mother to five children and is known by her community as a very hardworking individual.<br /><br />Initially, Miriam joined One Acre Fund in 2006 because she wanted to get the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds. Since she joined the program, she says that her life has improved, especially because she has been able to consistently feed her family. With the profits from the coming harvesting season, Miriam plans to send her children to school.<br /><br />Between the ten farmers in Miriam's Group, a total of 4.25 acres of land will be planted using the maize seeds and fertilizer received with the loan.
