  "description": "Fatmata (1st on left), is the featured borrower of Fatmata K's Female Farmers. Fatmata is a Master Farmer in the Wore-Bana village and has a large family of 8. <br /><br />Fatmata is a strong leader in the community and regularly organizes women's activities. She is a seasoned farmer who lost her business in addition to several extended family members during the Ebola crisis. She refuses to give up despite losing a lifetime of work. She organized a large group of other women who similarly had prospered before the crisis but lost everything.  <br /><br />All members are currently trapped in a cycle of subsistence and take extremely high-interest loans for poor quality inputs during planting time. A no-interest Kiva loan will therefore enable this group of determined women to get back on their feet and back in business.",
