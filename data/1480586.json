  "description": "Emily is a 36-year-old proud mother of 4 children. She is a group leader, often described as a very trustworthy person, and is representing her group of 7 farmers in Matete District. Since joining One Acre Fund in 2014, Emily has noticed that she has been able to save more money.<br /><br />Emily described her harvest as very good last year but believes she can have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. She is very excited to also be purchasing a solar light, apart from fertilizer and maize, because she will now be able to have light during dark hours for her children to be able to study. With the profits from this season’s harvest, she plans to repair her home.<br /><br />With this loan, Emily’s Group will be able to plant 1 acre of land and purchase a total of 7 solar lights.",
