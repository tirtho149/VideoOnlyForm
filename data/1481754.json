  "description": "Beatrice's Group is formed by 15 farmers in Teso District and is being represented by Beatrice, who is the group leader pictured above. She is 50 years old and has 5 children. Beatrice has been a farmer for 20 years and is often referred to as a very reliable person.<br /><br />Beatrice isn’t new to One Acre Fund, she actually joined the program in 2015 and has since noticed her life has changed, especially in the sense that she has been able to consistently feed her family ever since. This year, Beatrice will not only get fertilizer and maize seeds as part of her loan, but will also purchase two solar lights. She is very excited about this addition since she will now be able to have light during dark hours for her children to be able to study.<br /><br />Using this loan, Beatrice's Group will purchase a total of 9 solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of 8.5 acres.",
