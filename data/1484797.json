  "description": "Pictured above is Margaret, who, as a group leader, is representing her group formed by 12 farmers in Chwele District, Kenya. She is a mother to 10 children and is known by her community as a very reliable person.<br /><br />Initially, Margaret joined One Acre Fund in 2010 because she wanted to get the best-quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds. Since she joined the program she says that her life has improved, especially because she has been able to consistently feed her family. With the profits from the coming harvesting season, Margaret plans to buy a cow.<br /><br />Between the 12 farmers in Margaret's Group, a total of 12 acres of land will be planted using the maize seeds and fertilizer received with the loan. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light, so with this loan, the group will also receive a total of eight solar lights.",
