  "description": "Pictured above is Eclay, who, as a group leader, is representing her group formed by 5 farmers in Matete District, Kenya. She is a mother to 5 children, and is known by her community as a very experienced farmer.<br /><br />Initially, Eclay joined One Acre Fund in 2012 because she wanted to get the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds. Since she joined the program she says that her life has improved, especially because she has been able to consistently feed her family. With the profits from the coming harvesting season, Eclay plans to invest in a business.<br /><br />Between the 5 farmers in Eclay's Group, a total of 4 acres of land will be planted using the maize seeds and fertilizer received with the loan. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light so, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 2 solar lights.",
