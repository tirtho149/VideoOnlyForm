  "description": "Pictured above is Jackline, who, as a group leader, is representing her group formed by 14 farmers in Sirisia District, Kenya. She is a mother to 6 children and is known by her community as a very friendly person.<br /><br />Initially, Jackline joined One Acre Fund in 2011 because she wanted to earn enough to feed her family. Since she joined the program, she says that her life has improved, especially because she has been able to consistently feed her family. With the profits from the coming harvesting season, Jackline plans to send her children to school.<br /><br />Between the 14 farmers in Jackline's Group, a total of 7.75 acres of land will be planted using the maize seeds and fertilizer received with the loan. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light so, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 7 solar lights.",
