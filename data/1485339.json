  "description": "Pictured above is Florence who, as a group leader, is representing her group formed by 13 farmers in Sirisia District, Kenya. She is a mother to seven children and is known by her community as a very resourceful person.<br /><br />Florence joined One Acre Fund in 2009 because she wanted to get the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds. Since she joined the program she says that her life has improved, especially because she has been able to consistently feed her family. With the profits from the coming harvesting season, Florence plans to send her children to school.<br /><br />Between the 13 farmers in Florence's Group, a total of 7.25 acres of land will be planted using the maize seeds and fertilizer received with the loan. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light so, with this loan, the group will receive a total of eight solar lights.",
