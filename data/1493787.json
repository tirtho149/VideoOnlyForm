  "description": "Patrick is hardworking man who does farming in the rural area to provide for his family. He is married with school-going children. He opted for food crops because they take a short period to mature and also their market is readily available due to the fact that people eat every day. <br /><br />Patrick is a proud farmer because apart from earning income, food security at home is also guaranteed. On harvest, he supplies the farm produce to the food markets in Ntungamo and the sorrounding areas. With the money he gets, he provides the family with the basic necessities as well as educating his children. <br /><br />In a bid to improve his farming, Patrick has applied for a loan of UGX 2,000,000 from UGAFODE to buy organic fertilizers for his banana plantation. He is hopeful that the quality and quantity of his farm yields will improve, which will attract competitive prices, thus bringing in more income. <br /><br />Patrick appreciates the funders for the support that will improve his farming and also transform him financially. However, the unpredictable price fluctuations are a challenge to him and other farmers at large.",
