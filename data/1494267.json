  "Name": "Conrad's Group",
  "description": "Conrad is a 30-year-old proud father of three children. He is a group leader, often described as a very experienced farmer, and is representing his group of eight farmers in Teso District. Since joining One Acre Fund in 2013, Conrad has noticed that he has had a healthier life due to better nutrition.<br /><br />Conrad described his harvest as very good last year, but he believes he can have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. He is very excited to also be purchasing two solar lights, apart from fertilizer and maize, because he will now be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money. With the profits from this season’s harvest, he plans to buy a cow.<br /><br />With this loan, Conrad’s Group will be able to plant a total of 3.75 acres of land and purchase a total of eight solar lights.",
