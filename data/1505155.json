  "description": "Fateem is a 33-year-old married Syrian refugee living in Lebanon. Three years ago, she decided to move to Lebanon with her family in an attempt to escape war that ravaged her nation. Fateem's family is made up of her husband and five children.<br /><br />In the same year, she started her own flower selling business. Fateem used her experience and love of agriculture by using the land next to her house to grow flowers so she can sell them. Today, she is acquiring this loan from Kiva's field partner Al Majmoua to buy a new collection of flower seeds and bulbs to use in her business. Fateem hopes that she would be able to buy a house.",
