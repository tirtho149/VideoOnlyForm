It enabled them to break free from the local lenders who were charging them nearly 100% interest, and as a result, all group members have fully recovered their businesses, have repaid their first loan and are successfully farming again after the devastation of Ebola. <br /><br />The group is now seeking a second loan to expand further. The profits will be used to ensure all member's children go to school, and will also be used by the group to create a support fund for young female farmers.",
