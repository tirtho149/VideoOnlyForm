He has been a farmer for 20 years and is often referred to as a very hardworking individual.<br /><br />Benard isn’t new to One Acre Fund as he actually joined the program in 2014 and has since noticed his life has changed, especially in the sense that he has been able to consistently feed his family ever since. This year, Benard will not only get fertilizer and maize seeds as part of his loan, but will also purchase a solar light. He is very excited about this addition since now he will be able to have an overall improved quality of life.<br /><br />Using this loan, Benard's Group will purchase a total of eight solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of five acres.",
