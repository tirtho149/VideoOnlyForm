  "description": "Living in a local village of Tbaung Khmum province, Sreyneang is 21 years old and a mother of two young children. For the past six years, she has overcome her family’s hardship via rice cropping and working as a paid worker. This has returned her about 7 USD per day. <br /><br />This is Sreyneang’s first loan cycle with VisionFund. In a group of two members, she is the group leader. She will use this loan portion to buy fertilizer and organic pesticide to input on her rice farmland to produce good yields. <br /><br />With this loan, she hopes to gain higher yields and more income so she can expand her farm to be larger next year.",
