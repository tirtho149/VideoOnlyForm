  "description": "Everlyne 's Group is formed by 15 farmers in Kimilili District and is being represented by Everlyne, who is the group leader pictured above. She is 41 years old and has 9 children. Everlyne has been a farmer for 10 years and is often referred to as a very experienced farmer.<br /><br />Everlyne isn’t new to One Acre Fund; she actually joined the program in 2015 and has since noticed her life has changed, especially in the sense that she has been able to consistently feed her family ever since. This year, Everlyne  will not only get fertilizer and maize seeds as part of her loan, but will also purchase two solar lights. She is very excited about this addition since now she will be able to have light during dark hours for her children to be able to study.<br /><br />Using this loan, Everlyne 's Group will purchase a total of 12 solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of 5.25 acres.",
