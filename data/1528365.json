  "Name": "Alice's Group",
  "description": "Alice's Group is formed by 10 farmers in Sirisia District and is being represented by Alice, who is the group leader pictured above. She is 37 years old and has 5 children. Alice has been a farmer for 20 years and is often referred to as a very friendly person.<br /><br />Alice isn’t new to One Acre Fund: she actually joined the program in 2015 and has since noticed that her life has changed. She has been able to consistently feed her family ever since. This year, Alice will not only get fertilizer and maize seeds as part of her loan, but will also purchase a solar light. She is very excited about this addition since now she will be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.<br /><br />Using this loan, Alice's Group will purchase a total of 5 solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of 8.75 acres.",
