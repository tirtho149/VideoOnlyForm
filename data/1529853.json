  "Name": "Wilson's Group",
  "description": "Pictured is Wilson, often described as an extremely resourceful person. He is 45 years old and has seven children. As a group leader, he is representing a group of nine farmers from Matete district, Kenya. <br /><br />Wilson is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund as this means that he is able to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods, which is why he decided to join in the first place. Wilson says that he is happy to have made that decision because, since he first joined in 2015, he has had more profits from each harvest, which has improved his day-to-day life significantly. Wilson will use the profits from this season to buy a cow.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 8.5 acres. Given that a member of the group will also be purchasing a solar light with this loan, the group will also receive one solar light.",
