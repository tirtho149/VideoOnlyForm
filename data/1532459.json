  "description": "Denia works in agriculture, growing green beans and carrots, but with this loan going forward she would like to grow green beans and squash. She works hard for her family, delivering her produce to the cooperative in her area, selling whatever is left over at the terminal in the capital. She also works part-time as an elementary school teacher, and works at her business on weekends and some afternoons. Denia works hard at her business because it helps pay for her university studies. She is grateful for having been given this opportunity, and is confident that she will get ahead with the help of this loan.",
