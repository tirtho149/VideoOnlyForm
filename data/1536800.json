  "description": "Hamisu is married and lives with his family in a simple mud house in a small village in the Kaduna state of Nigeria. In his community, farming is the primary occupation and, like many hardworking smallholders, he dreams of growing his farm business.<br /><br />Hamisu is returning to work with Babban Gona this season as he will get access to better-yielding seeds, fertilizers and other essential farm supplies that will boost his yield. Apart from increasing Hamisu’s yield to ensure that his family never goes hungry, this loan will also help him earn up to 3 times his net income from selling his maize. Since he first joined Babban Gona in 2016, his happiest memory was building a better house for his family.<br /><br />With lenders’ support to grow his farming business, Hamisu is looking forward to an abundant harvest. Hamisu plans to use the profits from this season’s harvest to pay his children's school fees.",
