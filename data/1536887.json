  "description": "Ibrahim is married and lives with his family in a modest mud house in a small village in Kaduna state. Farming is the primary occupation in his community and like many industrious smallholders, Ibrahim dreams of expanding his farm business.<br /><br />Ibrahim is returning to work with Babban Gona this season as he will get access to better-yielding seeds, fertilizers and other essential farm inputs that will boost his yield. Apart from increasing Ibrahim’s yield to ensure that his family never goes hungry, this loan will also help him earn up to 3 times in net income from selling his maize. Since he first joined Babban Gona in 2015, his happiest memory has been buying more farmland.<br /><br />With lenders’ support to grow his farming business, Ibrahim is looking forward to an abundant harvest. Ibrahim plans to use the profits from this season’s harvest to purchase additional farmland.",
