  "Name": "Hamza",
  "description": "Hamza is married and lives with his family in a simple mud house in a small village in Kaduna state. In his community, farming is the primary occupation and, like many diligent smallholders, he dreams of growing his farm business.<br /><br />He is returning to work with Babban Gona this season as he will get access to better-yielding seeds, fertilizers, and other essential farm inputs that will boost his yield. Apart from increasing Hamza’s yield to ensure that his family never goes hungry, this loan will also help him earn up to 3 times in net income, compared to the average Nigerian farmer, from selling his maize. <br /><br />Since he first joined Babban Gona in 2017, his happiest memory was feeding his family all the time.<br /><br />With lenders’ support to grow his farming business, Hamza is looking forward to a bountiful harvest. He plans to use the profits from this season’s harvest to open an agro dealer shop.",
