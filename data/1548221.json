  "description": "Nancy is a farmer and is also a woman concerned about the welfare of her family. She lives in Gatundu South, Kenya with her husband and three children. She wants to buy a Sistema Biobolsa in order to save time and to pay for the education of her children. Nancy spends too much time chopping wood and then taking it to her farm, where she uses it to cook her children's food. With its biodigester from Sistema Biobolsa she will transform manure into renewable biogas energy.<br /><br />Nancy realized that she can take advantage of the waste from her farm and offer her family many benefits and a better quality of life. As she begins to place animal waste in the biodigester, the bacteria will turn it into biogas for cooking and the fertilizer-rich nutrients will be applied in in her field of vegetables. All this will allow her to increase her performance to eat healthier and improve her life.<br /><br />This loan represents 62% of the total price of the biodigester; the remaining part is paid directly by Nancy and the Kenya Biogas Program.",
