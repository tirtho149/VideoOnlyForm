  "description": "Edinah is 31 years old and lives in the Eldoret area of Kenya. She is a rural smallholder farmer, and a mother who earned her knowledge in farming from her parents. She is determined to pass on this knowledge to her village counterparts in the Eldoret area of Kenya. The results of her determination are the smiling faces of her children when they wake up early every day to go to school. Through experience based on curiosity and her natural abilities, Edinah has emerged as one of the most respected farmers in her village. <br /><br />Although she makes a profit from farming, Edinah is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by buying seeds, so that she can plant them and sell the crops. This is why she is requesting this loan; she wants to buy farm inputs such as certified seeds and nutrient-rich fertilizers, to improve her horticulture farming. <br /><br />Edinah’s remote area has a high demand for food. This means that she could increase her profits and meet the local demand for horticulture products. Edinah feels relieved because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with the wonderful Kiva lenders to help hardworking and honest women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and microfinancing. <br /><br />Edinah believes that this loan will be of help and that she will be able to meet the local demand for horticulture crops. Kindly lend to her!",
