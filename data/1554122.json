  "description": "Gladys is a mom who loves fashion and the color white and also is an enterprising young woman, smart and creative. She knows how to overcome the problems that life presents and, despite having no formal employment, she has never given up looking for ways to support herself through practicing mixed farming. <br /><br />Gladys is a rural smallholder farmer from the Kenyenya area of Kenya. She is married to a fellow farmer and has lovely children. Her family's main income source is milk from their dairy farm and crop farming. However, they are involved in other agricultural activities such as growing maize, vegetables, fruits, and cereals. The biggest problem being faced by farmers from her village is the huge deficit in access to agricultural inputs, meaning that farmers' yields and incomes are far below what they could be. <br /><br />Juhudi Kilimo partnered with Kiva to provide financial services to smallholders around Kenya. Through these financial services, farmers from Kenyenya like Gladys now can buy productive assets and important agricultural inputs for use on their farms. <br /><br />Gladys is seeking a loan to buy farm inputs such as seeds, fertilizer, herbicides, and pesticides. Your loan will enable her to improve her production through the use of quality farm inputs. This intervention will help her fill the increasing demand for food in the market and, in the process, generate more income to repay the loan debt and elevate the quality of life for her family.",
