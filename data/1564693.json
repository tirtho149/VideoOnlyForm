  "description": "I was born and raised in Manhattan, just blocks away from School For The Dogs. I grew up in my parents' workplaces, literally: My father was a freelance artist and my mother ran her own small business out of our home.  I was always drawn to animals, and began a dog walking business when I was just ten years old. I spent my 20s working as a journalist in NYC, but always harbored an interest in training. I eventually went to school to learn how to be a dog trainer. When I met Kate Senisi in 2011, we were both trying to figure out how to turn our passions into careers. Together, we founded School For The Dogs and haven't looked back!",
