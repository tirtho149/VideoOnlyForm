  "description": "Joana is an enterprising young woman who works in agriculture in her village. Every day, she is doing her activity by growing and planting many kinds of flowers. After the flowers are grown, she then sells them at the local market and some times people come to buy at her place. She has been making a living from her flowers farm for many years now with her own working capital. <br /><br />Now, she is requesting a $1,000 USD loan through KIF to help with her farming activity. Every day she is busy with farming because she is earning a good income from it. Joana will use this loan to buy more manure, fertilizer, some new type of flower seeds, and new farming equipment to grow more flowers to sell.",
