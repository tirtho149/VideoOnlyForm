  "description": "Pictured above is Fidelis, often described as an extremely experienced farmer. He is 69 years old and has 8 children. As a group leader, he is representing his group of 7 farmers in Kilolo North District, Tanzania. <br /><br />Fidelis is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again as this means that he is able to get the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds, which is why he decided to join in the first place. Fidelis says that he is happy to have made that decision because, since he first joined in 2018, he has been able to save more money, which has improved his day to day life significantly. Fidelis will use the profits from this season to repair his home.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 8 acres.",
