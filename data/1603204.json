  "Name": "Prisca's Group",
  "description": "This season is not the first one that Prisca is working alongside One Acre Fund. She has been a member for a few years now, having joined the program in 2017 and, although she is the only person featured in the above picture, she is actually representing her group of six farmers in Kilolo North District, Tanzania.<br /><br />Prisca is often described by her community as a very friendly person and decided to be the one to represent her group because she wanted to be more active in her community. Like many of her fellow farmers, Prisca decided to be part of One Acre Fund community in order to get the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds and hopes to use the profits from this year’s harvest to repair her home.<br /><br />This loan will not only help Prisca but the whole group, who will receive maize seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 5.5 acres of land.",
