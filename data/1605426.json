  "description": "Junus, pictured above, has been a farmer for more than 20 years, and is now proud to represent his group of 11 farmers in Kilolo South District. He is 61 years old, married and has 4 children.<br />Junus likes to think of himself as a very friendly person. He has been working alongside One Acre Fund since 2015 and decided to represent his group because he likes being a leader. He says that being part of the One Acre Fund community has meant that he has had more profits from each harvest. Junus plans to use the profits from this coming season to rent more land to cultivate in.<br /><br />In total, Junus’s Group will receive inputs to cultivate 8.5 acres of land. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 2 solar lights.",
