  "description": "Kalista's Group is formed by 11 farmers in Kilolo South District and is being represented by Kalista, who is the group leader pictured above. She is 46 years old and has 6 children. Kalista has been a farmer for more than 20 years and is often referred to as a very friendly person.<br /><br />Kalista isn’t new to One Acre Fund, she actually joined the program in 2016 and has since noticed her life has changed; especially in the sense that she has been able to consistently feed her family ever since. This year, Kalista will not only get fertilizer and maize seeds as part of her loan, but will also purchase a solar light. She is very excited about this addition since now she will be able to have light during the night and have somewhere to charge her phone.<br /><br />Using this loan, Kalista's Group will purchase a total of 4 solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of 7.5 acres.",
