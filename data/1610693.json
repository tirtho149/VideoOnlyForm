  "description": "Getrude's Group is formed by five farmers in Iringa Two District and is being represented by Getrude, who is the group leader pictured above. She is 50 years old and has six children. Getrude has been a farmer for more than 20 years and is often referred to as a very reliable person.<br /><br />Getrude isn’t new to One Acre Fund. She actually joined the program in 2015 and has since noticed her life has changed, especially in the sense that she has learnt a lot from farming trainings ever since. <br /><br />This year, Getrude will not only get fertilizer and maize seeds as part of her loan, but will also purchase two solar lights. She is very excited about this addition because now she will be able to charge her phone.<br /><br />Using this loan, Getrude's Group will purchase a total of two solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of six acres.",
