She sells her produce at her local market to earn a living to support her children and herself. <br /><br />In the modern world, agriculture has become exceedingly dynamic, requiring upgrades to the kind of inputs that are being used. There is a need to use improved farming inputs for effective production. Phlomena is seeking this loan so that she can buy farming inputs such as hybrid seeds and fertilizer. The returns from the investment will change her life and that of her entire household, as she will use the additional income to raise their living standards and pay for her children's education. <br /><br />Phlomena has a great desire to succeed and also a desire that Kiva lenders will listen to her request and help her better her life.
