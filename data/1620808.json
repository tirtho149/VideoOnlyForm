  "description": "Tausila is 49 years old and has three children. She has been a farmer for more than 20 years and is said to be a very resourceful person. Even though Tausila is the only one featured in the above picture, she is actually representing her group formed by 11 farmers in Iringa District, Tanzania.<br /><br />Tausila started working alongside One Acre Fund in 2013 and decided to do so because she wanted to get the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds. Since then, she has seen her life improve, especially in the sense that she has been able to consistently feed her family. This year she decided to represent her group because she wanted to gain leadership skills.<br /><br />Tausila’s Group will receive farming inputs to plant a total of 15.5 acres of land. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light, so with this loan the group will also receive a total of two solar lights.",
