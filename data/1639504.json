  "description": "Veronica is a farmer in Progreso de Obregón and has ten thousand mojarras. She lives with one family member, and the money earned from the farm is the main source of income to support her family. <br /><br />Veronica is currently spending too much money on the propane required to heat her baby mojarras and to power her home for cooking and hot water. Her sixteen cubic meter Sistema Biobolsa biodigester will allow her to use the abundant mojarra manure on-site to produce biogas to replace propane. The biodigester will transform the \"waste\" into two important resources: methane-rich, renewable biogas and potent biofertilizer. Not only will Veronica use the biogas to heat her baby mojarras and cook and heat bathwater for her family but Veronica will also use the biofertilizer from the biodigester to increase yields on her crops. With this biofertilizer, she will no longer have to resort to expensive, petroleum-based agrochemical fertilizers.<br /><br />This loan represents 63% of the total cost of the biodigester; the remaining part is covered by a government subsidy.",
