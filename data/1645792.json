  "description": "Minouche is 23 years old. She stopped going to school when she became pregnant with her first child. Last year, Minouche sold some shoes to make some cash to live, but this activity could not go further because the supplier did not have stock. <br /><br />Minouche wouldn't like to give up fighting to live. She turned to a training in beekeeping. Now, she thinks a Kiva loan will definitely help her stand on her two feet again. <br /><br />Breeding some colonies will give her time to arrange to study again. Needless to say, an increase in her income is her top priority, apart from returning to school. That is why she is seeking a loan to buy materials to make hive-boxes.",
