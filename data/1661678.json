  "description": "Pictured above is Rael, who, as a group leader, is representing her group formed by 15 farmers in Kakamega B (North) District, Kenya. She is a mother to 6 children and is known by her community as a very experienced farmer.<br /><br />Initially, Rael joined One Acre Fund in 2013 because she wanted to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods. Since she joined the program she says that her life has improved, especially because she has had a healthier life due to better nutrition. With the profits from the coming harvesting season, Rael plans to send her children to school.<br /><br />Between the 15 farmers in Rael's Group, a total of 11.5 acres of land will be planted using the maize seeds and fertilizer received with the loan. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light so, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 5 solar lights.",
