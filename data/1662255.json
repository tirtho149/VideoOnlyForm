  "Name": "Lydia's Group",
  "description": "Lydia, pictured above, has been a farmer for four years, and is now proud to represent her group of nine farmers in Kakamega B (North) District. She is 32 years old, married and has three children.<br /><br />Lydia likes to think of herself as a very resourceful person. She has been working alongside One Acre Fund since 2014 and decided to represent her group because she wanted to spread the story of One Acre Fund farmers. She says that being part of the One Acre Fund community has meant that she has been able to consistently feed her family. Lydia plans to use the profits from this coming season to send her children to school.<br /><br />In total, Lydia’s Group will receive inputs to cultivate 4.5 acres of land. Given that one member of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of one solar light.",
