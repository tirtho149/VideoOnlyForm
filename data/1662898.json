  "description": "Pictured above is Melisa who is often described as an extremely reliable person. She is 33 years old and has 7 children. As a group leader, she is representing her group of 5 farmers in Mumias District, Kenya. <br /><br />Melisa is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again as this means that she is able to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods, which is why she decided to join in the first place. Melisa says that she is happy to have made that decision because, since she first joined in 2017, she has been able to consistently feed her family, improving her day-to-day life significantly. Melisa will use the profits from this season to send her children to school.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 2 acres. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 1 solar light.",
