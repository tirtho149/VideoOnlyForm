She is a group leader, often described as a very resourceful person, and is representing her group of 7 farmers in the Webuye District. Since joining One Acre Fund in 2015, Joynivah has noticed that she has a large farm group support.<br /><br />Joynivah described her harvest last year as very good, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. She is very excited to also be purchasing two solar lights, apart from fertilizer and maize, because she will now be able to have an overall improved quality of life. With the profits from this season’s harvest, she plans to repair her home.<br /><br />With this loan, Joynivah’s Group will be able to plant a total of 3 acres of land, and purchase a total of 3 solar lights.",
