  "Name": "Lydia's Group",
  "description": "Lydia, pictured above, has 10 children and is representing her group, formed by eight farmers in Webuye District, Kenya. She joined One Acre Fund for the first time in 2012 and decided to represent her group because she wanted to spread the story of One Acre Fund farmers. <br /><br />With a portion of this loan, Lydia will purchase not only maize seeds and fertilizer for the coming harvesting season but also a solar light. Receiving a solar light as part of her loan means that now she will be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money. Lydia plans to use the profits she gains this year to send her children to school.<br /><br />In total, Lydia’s Group will use the inputs received from this loan to plant a total of 6.25 acres of land. It will also receive a total of two solar lights.",
