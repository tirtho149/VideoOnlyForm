  "Name": "Aquiles",
  "description": "Aquiles lives in the village of Alto Tambillo, a small community of coffee growers in the outskirts of San Ignacio, Peru. He is 37 years old. From the time his grandfather passed away, Aquiles has lived in his friend William’s parents’ house. <br /><br />Aquiles maintains his own two-hectare parcel of coffee, and he generates other income by raising improved breed guinea pigs. He sells his coffee through his cooperative Cenfrocafe. From the time he was boy, his grandfather taught him farm work. He dreams of increasing his coffee area as well as having a large guinea pig farm.  <br /><br />A loan to Aquiles will give him the opportunity to improve his business by increasing his production through fertilization, thereby increasing the quality of his coffee. And with the income he earns, he will expand his guinea pig farm. He has been a member of Norandino for one year and is managing his obligations responsibly.",
