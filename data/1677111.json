  "description": "John lives in the outskirts of Ntungamo town, with his wife and children. He is into agriculture, mainly banana growing. He opted for food crops because they mature in a short period of time and their market is readily available due to the fact that people eat everyday. His clients include most of the food markets in Ntungamo and Mbarara.<br /><br />He has applied for a loan to buy organic fertilizers for his farm. He is hopeful that he will harvest good yields, which will attract competitive prices, thereby fetching a huge profit. He hopes to use the money to pay his children's school fees and also repay the loan. He appreciates the lenders for their support.<br /><br />The lady in the photo is a credit officer.",
