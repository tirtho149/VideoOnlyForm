  "description": "Shahira lives in a nice house with her husband and kids. They have a nice garden that she created. Her husband suggested turning her project into a business, so she started selling plants and flowers to her neighbors. Her husband then bought some thyme to plant and they had a good generous crop that they sold. <br /><br />A loan will help Shahira to buy an irrigation system, mainly a system of water hoses, to take care of her garden.",
