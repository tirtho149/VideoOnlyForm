  "description": "Jane, pictured above, has seven children and is representing her group, formed by 13 farmers in Webuye District, Kenya. <br /><br />She joined One Acre Fund for the first time in 2012 and decided to represent her group because she wanted to gain respect from her community. <br /><br />With a portion of this loan, Jane will not only purchase maize seeds and fertilizer for the coming harvesting season, but also a solar light. <br /><br />Receiving a solar light as part of her loan means that now she will be able to have light during the night and have somewhere to charge her phone. <br /><br />Jane plans to use the profits she gains this year to send her children to school.<br /><br />In total, Jane’s Group will use the inputs received from this loan to plant a total of 5.25 acres of land. The group will also receive a total of 7 solar lights.",
