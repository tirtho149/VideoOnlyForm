  "description": "Pictured above is Edwin, often described as an extremely hardworking individual. He is 43 years old and has six children. As a group leader, he is representing his group of eight farmers in Webuye District, Kenya. <br /><br />Edwin is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again as this means that he is able to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods, which is why he decided to join in the first place. Edwin says that he is happy to have made that decision because, since he first joined in 2014, he has had a healthier life due to better nutrition, which has improved his day-to-day life significantly. Edwin will use the profits from this season to send his children to school.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 3.5 acres. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of six solar lights.",
