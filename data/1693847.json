  "Name": "John",
  "description": "John lives in Kenya, where he's been farming for four years. He does dairy and crop farming, which is his source of income. He enjoys farming and especially dairy farming. His major challenge is getting feed for his livestock. John said he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer good products that suit low-income earners like him.<br /><br />He's seeking a 30,000 KES loan, which he'll use to pay for farm inputs and to hire labor to grow more crops. It takes a lot for a smallholder farmer to risk limited resources to expand a farm business. With your help, John will be able to cover the high cost of farm inputs necessary for expansion. <br /><br />A significant portion of the profits will be reinvested in the business to fuel growth as John sets a good foundation for his children. He hopes to be able to progress as a smallholder farmer and have a more stable income.",
