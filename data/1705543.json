  "description": "Pictured above is George, who, as a group leader, is representing his group formed by nine farmers in Kimilili, Kenya. He is a father to six children and is known in his community as a very experienced farmer.<br /><br />Initially, George joined One Acre Fund in 2012, because he wanted to get the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds. Since he joined the program, he says that his life has improved, especially because he has had more profits from each harvest. With the profits from the coming harvesting season, George plans to buy a cow.<br /><br />Among the nine farmers in George's Group, a total of six acres of land will be planted using the maize seeds and fertilizer received with the loan. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light so, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of two solar lights.",
