  "description": "Janerose's Group is formed by nine farmers in Teso District and is being represented by Janerose, who is the group leader pictured above. She is 45 years old and has eight children. She has been a farmer for 13 years and is often referred to as a very hardworking individual.<br /><br />Janerose isn’t new to One Acre Fund; she actually joined the program in 2015 and has since noticed her life has changed, especially in the sense that she has been able to consistently feed her family ever since. This year, Janerose will not only get fertilizer and maize seeds as part of her loan, but will also purchase a solar light. She is very excited about this addition, since now she will be able to have light during the night and have somewhere to charge her phone.<br /><br />Using this loan, Janerose's Group will purchase a total of 6 solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of 4 acres.",
