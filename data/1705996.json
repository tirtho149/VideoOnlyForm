  "description": "Ann's Group is formed by 5 farmers in Mumias District and is being represented by Ann, who is the group leader pictured above. She is 44 years old and has 6 children. Ann has been a farmer for more than 20 years and is often referred to as a very experienced farmer.<br /><br />Ann isn’t new to One Acre Fund, she actually joined the program in 2014 and has noticed her life has changed, especially in the sense that she has been able to save more money ever since. This year, Ann will not only get fertilizer and maize seeds as part of her loan, but will also purchase a solar light. She is very excited about this addition since now she will be able to have light during the night in order to feel safer.<br /><br />Using this loan, Ann's Group will purchase a total of 4 solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of 3.5 acres.",
