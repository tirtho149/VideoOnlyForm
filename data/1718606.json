  "description": "Wanyera's Group is formed by seven farmers in Mumias District and is being represented by Wanyera, who is the group leader pictured above. She is 43 years old, has five children and is often referred to as a very friendly person. <br /><br />Wanyera has been a farmer for 15 years.<br /><br />Wanyera isn’t new to One Acre Fund. She joined the program in 2016 and has noticed that her life has changed, especially in the sense that she has been able to consistently feed her family ever since. <br /><br />This year, Wanyera will not only get fertilizer and maize seeds as part of her loan, but will also purchase a solar light. She is very excited about this addition since now she will be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.<br /><br />Every member of the group will  be able to acquire a solar light as part of the loan.",
