  "description": "Rebeca, pictured above, has been a farmer for 20 years and is now proud to represent her group of seven farmers in Kakamega B (North) District. She is 40 years old, married, and has four children.<br /><br />Rebeca likes to think of herself as a very friendly person. She has been working alongside One Acre Fund since 2016 and decided to represent her group because she wanted to help more farmers. She says that being part of the One Acre Fund community has meant that she has learnt alot from farming trainings. Rebeca plans to use the profits from this coming season to save more money for the future.<br /><br />In total, Rebeca’s Group will receive inputs to cultivate 2.75 acres of land. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 2 solar lights.",
