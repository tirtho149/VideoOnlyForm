  "description": "Pictured above is Blasio, who, as a group leader, is representing his group formed by 13 farmers in Kakamega B (North) District, Kenya. He is a father to 10 children and is known by his community as a very resourceful person.<br /><br /><br />Initially, Blasio joined One Acre Fund in 2013 because he wanted to earn enough to send his children to school. Since he joined the program he says that his life has improved, especially because he has had more profits from each harvest. With the profits from the coming harvesting season, Blasio plans to send his children to school.<br /><br /><br />Between the 13 farmers in Blasio's Group, a total of 5.5 acres of land will be planted using the maize seeds and fertilizer received with the loan. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a total of 5 solar lights with this loan.",
