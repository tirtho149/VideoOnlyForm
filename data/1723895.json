  "description": "Margaret is a 29-year-old proud mother of two children. She is a group leader, often described as a very hardworking individual, and is representing her group of 11 farmers in Teso District. Since joining One Acre Fund in 2014, Margaret has noticed that she has been able to consistently feed her family.<br /><br />Margaret described her harvest as very good last year, but believes she can have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. She is very excited to also be purchasing a solar light, in addition to fertilizer and maize, because she will now be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money. With the profits from this season’s harvest, she plans to rent more land to cultivate.<br /><br />With this loan, Margaret’s Group will be able to plant a total of 3.75 acres of land and purchase a total of three solar lights.",
