He opened the business with the money he saved himself during  time and with Kiva's previous credit, <br /><br />The buyers appreciate the products from Serghei, especially that the briquettes and pellets are produced from straw, sawdust, branches, and sunflower shells, protecting the environment and nature. <br /><br />Serghei has bought some of the necessary equipment for the production process.  However, in order to work more efficiently, Sergei wants to buy a branch chopper, but does not have the necessary amount and makes an appeal for a Kiva loan.<br /><br />The acquisition of this branch chopper will help Serghei to increase his production volume with minimal expenses and to succeed in a short time to process more raw material.",
