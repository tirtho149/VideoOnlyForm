  "Name": "Florence's Group",
  "description": "Florence, pictured above, has 8 children and is representing her group, formed by 11 farmers in Webuye District, Kenya. She joined One Acre Fund for the first time in 2010 and decided to represent her group because she wanted to spread the story of One Acre Fund farmers. \n\nWith a portion of this loan, Florence will not only purchase maize seeds and fertilizer for the coming harvesting season, but also a solar light. Receiving a solar light as part of her loan means that now she will be able to have light during the night and have somewhere to charge her phone. Florence plans to use the profits she gains this year to send her children to school.\n\nIn total Florence’s Group will use the inputs received from this loan to plant a total of 3.5 acres of land. They will also receive a total of 15 solar lights.",
