He carries out a business of farming, where he grows bananas and does cattle-keeping, which he started in 1990 with the aim of improving his daily income. <br /><br />Geofrey has applied for a loan facility of 5,000,000 UGX to buy more cattle for fattening. He is hopeful that with this funding, he will be able to expand his cattle farm, thereby attracting more customers as well as income. <br /><br />Geofrey dreams of having a wide range of cattle alongside other businesses, like banana and maize plantations. He is a hardworking person who likes development in the community, hence improving his personal income. <br /><br />Thank you, lenders, for the kind support.",
