  "Name": "Violet's Group",
  "description": "Violet, pictured above, has six children and is representing her group, formed by 11 farmers in Teso District, Kenya. She joined One Acre Fund for the first time in 2013 and decided to represent her group because she wanted to spread the story of One Acre Fund farmers. <br /><br />With a portion of this loan, Violet will not only purchase maize seeds and fertilizer for the coming harvesting season, but also a solar light. Receiving a solar light as part of her loan means that now she will be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money. Violet plans to use the profits she gains this year to send her children to school.<br /><br />In total, Violet’s Group will use the inputs received from this loan to plant a total of 10.25 acres of land. They will also receive a total of seven solar lights.",
