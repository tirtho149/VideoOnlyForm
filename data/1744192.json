  "description": "Meet Gayane, a young farmer from Dashtadem Village, where she lives with her husband, 2 young children (ages 3 and 4), and her elderly grandmother. Agriculture has been her family's main activity for many years. The family owns a farm of cows, bulls, sheep, lambs, and piglets. <br /><br />Thanks to the sales of agri-products, the family is able to make a living. However, due to the seasonality of agricultural activities, her husband often travels abroad to earn money. <br /><br />Since farming needs constant enhancements and care, Gayane has applied for financial support. With the provided loan, she plans to purchase high-quality forage for her livestock. Gayane is sure that this will help to increase the farm's productivity and agri-business income. She is full of hope and will work hard to achieve her goals so her husband can come back to his family.",
