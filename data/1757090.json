  "description": "Janet is a 27-year-old proud mother of three children. She is a group leader, often described as a very reliable person, and is representing her group of nine farmers in Kakamega B (North) District. Since joining One Acre Fund in 2017, Janet has noticed that she has been able to consistently feed her family.<br /><br />Janet described her harvest as excellent last year, but believes she can have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. She is very excited to also be purchasing a solar light, apart from fertilizer and maize, because she will now be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money. With the profits from this season’s harvest, she plans to buy a cow.<br /><br />With this loan, Janet’s Group will be able to plant a total of 2.25 acres of land and purchase a total of seven solar lights.",
