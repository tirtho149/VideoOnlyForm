  "description": "Zainabu's Group is formed by 13 farmers in Mumias District and is being represented by Zainabu, who is the group leader pictured above. She is 45 years old and has five children. Zainabu has been a farmer for more than 20 years and is often referred to as a very trustworthy person.<br /><br />Zainabu isn’t new to One Acre Fund. She joined the program in 2015 and has since noticed how her life has changed, especially because she has had more profits from each harvest ever since. This year, Zainabu will not only get fertilizer and maize seeds as part of her loan, but will also purchase a solar light. She is very excited about this addition, because now she will be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.<br /><br />Using this loan, the members of Zainabu's Group will purchase a total of nine solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of 7.25 acres.",
