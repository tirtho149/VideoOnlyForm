  "Name": "Julius' Group",
  "description": "Julius, pictured above, has 5 children and is representing his group, formed by 8 farmers in Chwele District, Kenya. He joined One Acre Fund for the first time in 2013 and decided to represent his group because he wanted to gain leadership skills. <br /><br />With a portion of this loan, Julius will not only purchase maize seeds and fertilizer for the coming harvesting season, but also a solar light. Receiving a solar light as part of his loan means that now he will be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money. Julius plans to use the profits he gains this year to send his children to school.<br /><br />In total Julius’s Group will use the inputs received from this loan to plant a total of 1 acre of land. They will also receive a total of 5 solar lights.",
