  "description": "Pictured above is Vincent, who, as a group leader, is representing his group formed by 9 farmers in Kimilili District, Kenya. He is a father to 8 children and is known by his community as a very hardworking individual.<br /><br />Initially, Vincent joined One Acre Fund in 2011 because he wanted to get the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds. Since he joined the program he says that his life has improved, especially because he has had more profits from each harvest. With the profits from the coming harvesting season, Vincent plans to send his children to school.<br /><br />Between the 9 farmers in Vincent's Group, a total of 4 acres of land will be planted using the maize seeds and fertilizer received with the loan. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light so, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 5 solar lights.",
