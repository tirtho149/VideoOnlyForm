  "description": "Pictured above is Slyvia, often described as an extremely hardworking individual. She is 32 years old and has five children. As a group leader, she is representing her group of eight farmers in Chwele District, Kenya. <br /><br />Slyvia is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again because this means that she is able to earn enough to feed her family, which is why she decided to join in the first place. Slyvia says that she is happy to have made that decision because, since she first joined in 2015, she has had more profits from each harvest, which has improved her day-to-day life significantly. Slyvia will use the profits from this season to save more money for the future.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 6.25 acres. Given that one member of the group will also be purchasing a solar light with this loan, the group will also receive a total of one solar light.",
