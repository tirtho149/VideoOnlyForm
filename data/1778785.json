  "description": "Pictured above is Everline, often described as an extremely experienced farmer. She is 42 years old and has six children. As a group leader, she is representing her group of nine farmers in Kakamega B (North) District, Kenya. <br /><br />Everline is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again as this means that she is able to earn enough to feed her family, which is why she decided to join in the first place. Everline says that she is happy to have made that decision because, since she first joined in 2015, she has been able to consistently feed her family, which has improved her day-to-day life significantly. Everline will use the profits from this season to send her children to school.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of three acres. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of four solar lights.",
