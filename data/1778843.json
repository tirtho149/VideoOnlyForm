  "description": "Pictured above is Benson, who, as a group leader, is representing his group formed by 11 farmers in Mumias District, Kenya. He is a father to 5 children and is known by his community as a very hard-working individual.<br /><br />Initially, Benson joined One Acre Fund in 2013 because he wanted to earn enough to feed his family. Since joining the program, he says that his life has improved, especially because he has been able to consistently feed his family. With the profits from the coming harvesting season, Benson plans to buy a cow.<br /><br />Between the 11 farmers in Benson's Group, a total of 6 acres of land will be planted using the maize seeds and fertilizer received with the loan. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light.",
