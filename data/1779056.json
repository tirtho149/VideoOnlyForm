  "Name": "Mary's Group",
  "description": "Mary, pictured above, has six children and is representing her group, formed by 13 farmers in Kimilili District, Kenya. She joined One Acre Fund for the first time in 2013 and decided to represent her group because she wanted to be more active in her community. <br /><br />With a portion of this loan, she will not only purchase maize seeds and fertilizer for the coming harvesting season, but also a solar light. Receiving a solar light as part of her loan means that now she will be able to have light during dark hours for her children to be able to study. Mary plans to use the profits she gains this year to send her children to school.<br /><br />Mary’s Group will use the inputs received from this loan to plant a total of 9.5 acres of land. They will also receive two solar lights.",
