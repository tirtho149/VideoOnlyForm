  "Name": "Florine's Group",
  "description": "Florine is the leader of a twelve-member group of farmers in Mumias District, Kenya. She is 33 years old and has six children. Florine has been farming for six years and is often referred to as a very reliable person.<br /><br />Florine isn’t new to One Acre Fund; she joined the program in 2018 and has since noticed her life has changed, especially in that she has been able to consistently feed her family. This year, Florine will not only get fertilizer and maize seeds as part of her loan but will also buy three solar lights. She is very excited about this addition since now she will be able to reduce her consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.<br /><br />Using this loan, Florine's group will purchase a total of ten solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of 3.5 acres.",
