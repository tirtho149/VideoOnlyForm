  "description": "Pictured above is Judith, often described as an extremely experienced farmer. She is 38 years old and has 6 children. As a group leader, she is representing her group of 9 farmers in Mumias District, Kenya. <br /><br />Judith is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again as this means that she is able to earn enough to feed her family, which is why she decided to join in the first place. Judith says that she is happy to have made that decision because since she first joined in 2017, she has been able to consistently feed her family, which has improved her day-to-day life significantly. Judith will use the profits from this season to send her children to school.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 5.75 acres. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing solar lights, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 3 solar lights.",
