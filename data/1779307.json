She is a mother to nine children and is known by her community as a very trustworthy person.<br /><br />Initially, Florence joined One Acre Fund in 2012 because she wanted to earn enough to feed her family. Since she joined the program she says that her life has improved, especially because she has been able to consistently feed her family. <br /><br />With the profits from the coming harvesting season, Florence plans to send her children to school.<br /><br />The six farmers in Florence's Group will plant a total of 1.5 acres of land using the maize seeds and fertilizer received with the loan. Additionally, three of the farmers in the group will be purchasing solar lights with this loan.",
