  "description": "This is Damary, a humble mom of 3 school-going children who always smiles. She is a very hardworking woman who hails from Bungoma, Kenya, a land of seemingly never ending beauty. Despite living in a country where opportunities are scarce, she does not lose her hope and desire to succeed. Damary's primary sources of income are growing crops and animal farming. She also earns some income through a personal business. <br /><br />The biggest problem that farmers from Bungoma face is the huge deficit of access to agricultural inputs, meaning those farmers' yields and incomes are far below what they could be. Juhudi Kilimo has partnered with Kiva to provide financial services to smallholders around Kenya. Through these financial services, farmers from Bungoma, like Damary, can now buy productive assets and important agricultural inputs for use on their farms.<br /><br />Damary is seeking a loan to buy farm inputs such as fertilizer and quality seeds. Your loan will enable her to improve production through the use of quality farm inputs. This intervention will help her to meet the increasing demand for food in the market and thereby generate more income to repay the loan and improve her family's quality of life. <br /><br />Help this enterprising farmer to achieve her dreams.",
