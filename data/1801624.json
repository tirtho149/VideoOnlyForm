  "description": "Hamer is a 47-year-old farmer with good principles and a grand vision.  When he was younger, his parents taught him how to work the land and develop a love for this profession.  His farm measures 2.46 hectares and is designated for growing coffee.  With the advice he received from the technical team from PAC, Hamer implements the criteria for FLO, UTZ, and CAFÉ Practices certification.  <br /><br />Hamer lives with his wife and three children in the remote community of Nueva Segovia.  For more than 15 years, he has been planting and harvesting coffee.  Each year brings a new challenge for him to overcome and this year is no exception.  For this crop cycle, Hamer’s challenge is to build a coffee bean drying station.  This will allow him to increase his earnings for his family and also improve the quality of his coffee beans.  <br /><br />This is the 11th loan Hamer has received from PAC.",
