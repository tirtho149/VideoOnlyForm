  "description": "Gulkayir is 26 years old, married, and has 3 children. She is with her youngest son in the photo. Gulkayir has a secondary education. As the main income for her family, she has been breeding livestock and farming since 2011. Thanks to Gulkayir’s hard work, and with her husband’s help, today there are 8 cows, 30 sheep, and a horse on her farm. She has an agreement to supply organic milk to a local factory for further processing into dairy products. This allows her to continuously invest in her agricultural business. Having learned that she can get a loan from Bai Tushum Bank on the security of her contract for future delivery, within the product \"Chain of Value Added,\" she applied for a loan of 150,000 KGS to purchase dairy cows, in order to increase the volume of milk to sell. The factory’s payments for milk will be directly deposited to Gulkayir’s bank account, and loan payments will be automatically deducted. The loan income will help Gulkayir to further develop her farm and improve their living conditions.",
