  "description": "Kaukhar, 47, is married and has three children. She has completed higher education, and she works as a teacher in a local school. She understands agricultural technologies and knows how to invest funds in this area. As a source of additional income for her family, she has worked in animal husbandry and agriculture since 1993. Thanks to Kaukhar's tireless work on her farm, she currently has six cows, 20 sheep, three horses, and 0.68 hectares of irrigated land where she grows alfalfa.<br /><br />With the goal of further developing her farm, Kaukhar turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan in the amount of 200,000 KGS to buy pedigreed cattle. This is to increase income from breeding cattle. Kaukhar plans to invest the income from the loan in the purchase of livestock, as well as save funds for home repair and her son's marriage.",
