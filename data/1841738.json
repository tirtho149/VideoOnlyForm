He historically struggles to access credit for high-quality seeds and fertilizer, which compromises the quality of his harvest. <br /><br />Javan is excited to have access to high-quality inputs, advice and insurance from an Apollo Agriculture loan, to increase his yields.<br /><br />With this bundled package, Javan expects higher profits this season, which he hopes to invest back into his farm in subsequent seasons.",
