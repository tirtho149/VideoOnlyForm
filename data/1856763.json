  "description": "Rayyan is a maize farmer from the rural area of Kaduna, a state located in northern Nigeria who looks forward to earning higher profits from farming.  As a member of Babban Gona, Rayyan has access to high quality inputs and enhanced farming services which help to increase his yield.\n\nFurthermore, through training programs, Rayyan now practices farming in a more sustainable manner. For example, the fertilizer education Rayyan receives focuses on micro-dosing fertilizers to lessen environmental impact and increase yields. Rayyan expects to reap 35 bags/hectare, or double the national Nigerian average of 18 bags/hectare from this year's harvest.   Rayyan however needs a Harvest Advance loan to avoid losing margins by selling his maize at harvest, when prices are low due to the high supply of maize. \n\nThe Harvest Advance loan will provide Rayyan with cash equivalent to his value of maize at harvest. Babban Gona will then help Rayyan to store his maize and sell it at a higher price in the future, guaranteeing higher returns. This is crucial to Rayyan as he plans on using the increased income to build a better house for the family.",
