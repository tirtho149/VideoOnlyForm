  "description": "44 year old Lilliana is married and lives with her husband and children, who are her priority. She is requesting a loan to purchase the seeds, fertilizers and supplies required to improve and maximize her tomato crops while at the same time making the most use of her plots for additional planting. She has spent years growing tomatoes, which has given her the experience required to produce high-quality crops. Lilliana hopes that this investment will improve her family's quality of life and provide them with more economic stability. She also wants to continue to grow as a person and as a small businesswoman. This will  be the first loan Lilliana has received from FUDECOSUR. She has not previously been granted loans by federal banks, in contrast, FUDECOSUR made the process easy and offered a far lower interest rate.",
