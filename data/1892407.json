  "description": "Pictured above is Laban, who, as a group leader, is representing his group formed by 15 farmers in Matete District, Kenya. He is a father to 7 children and is known by his community as a very hardworking individual.<br /><br />Initially, Laban joined One Acre Fund in 2013 because he wanted to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods. Since he joined the program he says that his life has improved, especially because he has been able to consistently feed his family. With the profits from the coming harvesting season, Laban plans to send his children to school.<br /><br />Between the 15 farmers in Laban's Group, a total of 7.25 acres of land will be planted using the maize seeds and fertilizer received with the loan. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light, so with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 4 solar lights.",
