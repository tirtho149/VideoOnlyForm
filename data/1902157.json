  "description": "Pictured above is Anna, who, as a group leader, is representing her group formed by 12 farmers in Matete District, Kenya. She is a mother to 6 children and is known by her community as a very hardworking individual.\n\nInitially, Anna joined One Acre Fund in 2012 because she wanted to earn enough to feed her family. Since she joined the program she says that her life has improved, especially because she has been able to consistently feed her family. With the profits from the coming harvesting season, Anna plans to send her children to school.\n\nBetween the 12 farmers in Anna's Group, a total of 4.75 acres of land will be planted using the maize seeds and fertilizer received with the loan. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light so, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 6 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
