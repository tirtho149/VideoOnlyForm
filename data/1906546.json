  "Name": "Leonard's Group",
  "description": "Leonard is the group leader of his group in Teso District, and he is representing 11 farmers, including himself. Leonard joined One Acre Fund for the first time this season, but he has been a farmer for 2 years.\n\nLike many other farmers, Leonard decided to work with One Acre Fund in order to make more farmer friends in his community. He hopes that by joining One Acre Fund and using the seeds and fertilizer he will get with this loan, he can join the ranks of One Acre Fund farmers that have doubled their harvest in their first year of the program. He plans to use the profits he earns from this year’s harvest to buy a goat.\n\nLeonard's Group will use the farming inputs received with this loan to cultivate a total of 3 acres of land. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light so, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 4 solar lights.\n",
