  "description": "Pictured above is Manase, often described as an extremely friendly person. He is 70 years old and has eight children. As a group leader, he is representing his group of six farmers in Mumias District, Kenya. <br /><br />Manase is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund, as this means that he is able to have access to the best seed prices, which is why he decided to join in the first place. Manase says that he is happy to have made that decision, because since he first joined in 2017, he has been able to consistently feed his family, which has improved his day-to-day life significantly. Manase will use the profits from this season to send his children to school.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of four and a half acres.",
