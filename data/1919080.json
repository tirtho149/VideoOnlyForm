  "description": "Pictured above is Wycliffe, often described as an extremely resourceful person. He is 54 years old and has nine children. As a group leader, he is representing his group of 10 farmers in Teso District, Kenya. <br /><br />Wycliffe is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again as this means that he is able to earn enough to feed his family, which is why he decided to join in the first place. Wycliffe says that he is happy to have made that decision because, since he first joined in 2015, he has had a healthier life due to better nutrition, which has improved his day-to-day life significantly. Wycliffe will use the profits from this season to buy more land to cultivate.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 4.75 acres. Given that a member of the group will also be purchasing a solar light with this loan, the group will also receive one solar light.",
