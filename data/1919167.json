  "description": "Seen here with her hand raised, Oliva is a member of the Twehaireyo Group, where members guarantee one another for a loan. She is a single mother with three children and lives in Masindi, Uganda. She works hard managing both a farm and beauty salon to earn money for her family’s basic needs. Local people are her main customers, yet she is challenged by local competition as well as limited capital that hinders future prospects of expanding her farm.<br /><br />Oliva grows food crops such as beans, maize, and sweet potatoes. Pests and diseases that attack her crops are always a challenge. She previously asked for a loan to pay labor to help her in weeding, mulching, and applying fertilizers to her fields. Now she has requested a loan to add more inventory to her salon.",
