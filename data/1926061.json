He is 36 years old, married and has 3 children.<br /><br />Paul likes to think of himself as a very reliable person. He has been working alongside One Acre Fund since 2019 and decided to represent his group because he wanted to spread the story of One Acre Fund farmers. He says that being part of the One Acre Fund community has meant that he has been able to save more money. Paul plans to use the profits from this coming harvest season to send his children to school.<br /><br />In total, Paul’s Group will receive inputs to cultivate 3.25 acres of land.",
