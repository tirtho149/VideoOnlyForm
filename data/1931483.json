  "description": "Zipporah is 40 years old and has four children. She has been a farmer for 15 years and is always said to be a very resourceful person. <br /><br />Even though Zipporah is the only one featured in the above picture, she is actually representing her group formed by 15 farmers in Matete District, Kenya.<br /><br />Zipporah started working alongside One Acre Fund a few years ago, in 2012, and decided to do so because she wanted to earn enough to feed her family. Since then, she has seen her life improve, especially in the sense that she has been able to save more money. <br /><br />This year she decided to represent her group because she wanted to help more farmers.<br /><br />Zipporah’s Group will receive farming inputs to plant a total of 8.25 acres of land. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light so, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of four solar lights.",
