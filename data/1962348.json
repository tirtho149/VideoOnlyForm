  "description": "Ion thanks Kiva lenders for the previous loan that helped him to buy film to cover the greenhouse and seeds to plant. Due to this, he was able to develop his farm and that's what he wants most. <br /><br />Ion continues to deal with agriculture. The fruit helped him to earn an income to support the family. He intends to diversify production, namely by sowing watermelons. Not having the necessary sources of income, Ion decided to apply for another loan from Kiva for planting watermelon seeds, and getting drippers and film for the greenhouse. He hopes this will bring him a better income to improve the family's living conditions.",
