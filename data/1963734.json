  "description": "Guadalupe, affectionately known as Doña Lupe, is a 50 year old woman, the mother of four children, and single.  <br /><br />She has worked in the fields for five years; her primary activity there is growing coffee. Before this, she worked growing basic grains in another community where she lived for ten years; then she moved to another community where she has worked growing coffee. She farms in the traditional way, and so her yield is normal. Therefore, she feels the need to request financing to adequately care for her crops. Also, she has income from remittances from relatives living in other countries; they deposit funds monthly that cover household expenses. <br /><br />She aspires to cultivate her small area of production to obtain good crop yields, because she is planning to improve her house. To do this, she needs financial support to get ahead with her goals. She requests a loan from Fundenuse with Kiva funds to buy agricultural supplies for her coffee crop.  She belongs to the communal bank   “Jehová es Mi Pastor Río Grande” with Edvin and Yader.",
