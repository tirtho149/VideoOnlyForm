  "description": "ODEF is a microfinance institution located in San Pedro Sula, Honduras. ODEF has worked with Kiva to provide loans to borrowers in Honduras for more than 7 years. During that time, Kiva lenders have helped them serve over 8,000 borrowers with more than $5,000,000 lent through the Kiva platform. The philosophy of ODEF is to provide loans to the most vulnerable sectors of the informal economy, doing so with a high degree of social commitment. \nLike many businesses around the world, ODEF is unable to operate normally as a result of the crisis. Honduras has taken significant measures to reduce the spread of COVD-19, such as restricting movement and only allowing essential businesses to operate. ODEF needs access to flexible working capital to be able to pay employee salaries and to disburse loans to clients that are able to run their businesses or tend to their crops during the stay-at-home order in Honduras. By supporting this loan, you're helping ODEF to weather this crisis and be in a position to continue to serve their farmers, indigenous communities, single mothers, and many other clients in the aftermath of the pandemic as they recover from the economic impacts of the crisis. \nThis loan is part of Kiva’s Crisis Support Loan program to assist our Field Partner organizations directly so they can continue to support our borrowers. Because it is part of a pilot program, this loan may have higher risk. Read more in the \"More about this loan\" section below.",
