  "description": "María, 37, is a woman who has great aspirations in life. She thinks that union is strength and, together with her husband, they provide better living conditions for her five children, ages 10 to 20. <br /><br />María's husband is a tomato, pea and green bean farmer, and she is a talented weaver of typical “huipiles” blouses. The income that the couple generates allows them to provide primary and secondary education to all their children. <br /><br />María is aware that the success she has obtained is thanks to her diligence, taking savings and accessing a loan. Hoping to support her husband in the agricultural business and continue to grow in her textile business, Maria is applying for her first Kiva loan. She will buy a variety of yarn as well as agricultural fertilizer.<br /><br />The 12 women from the Communal Bank of the Friendship Bridge, “Azucenas de San Jose Yalu,” are from the Kaqchikel ethnic group and live in a rural area of ​​the Department of Sacatepéquez. In addition to access to the loan for the textile and agriculture businesses, they benefit from the training they receive monthly. <br /><br />María shares: \"An important theme for my life: customer service and health care for women. Proper handwashing and keeping my home disinfected help me protect and take care of my health and that of my family.\" This is thanks to the Friendship Bridge “Plus” program that combines small loans, formal education and health.<br /><br />Thank you!",
