  "description": "Michael lives in Tharaka-Nithi. As many farmers in his region do, he used to buy firewood to power his farm, but this has become a problem; now trees are scarce, making it even more difficult for farmers to have affordable access to energy. Michael plans to use a Sistema Biobolsa biodigester to eliminate wood, fossil fuels and chemical fertilizers from his farm.<br /><br />With his 12 cubic meter Sistema Biobolsa, Michael will transform his cow manure into renewable energy and organic fertilizer. He and his family will be able to cook without smoke and stop spending time chopping wood. Michael will also increase his vegetable productivity with the organic fertilizer that the biodigester produces and give back to the soil the nutrients needed to reforest Tharaka-Nithi.<br /><br />This loan represents 65% of the full price of the biodigester; the remaining part was covered by a cash down payment and a government subsidy.\"",
