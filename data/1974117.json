  "description": "I am a socially conscious small business owner with significant ties to the Philippines. The passion for coffee along with the plight of those farmers has always been part of me. When I realized that the coffee industry was in a resurgence due to the global demand for coffee, I reached out to family members to create a business solely based on Filipino coffee.  Venture Coffee Company was created to import coffee directly from the farmers to the USA. \n\nDuring my involvement, I have seen small villages prosper and grow from the production of coffee.",
