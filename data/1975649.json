  "description": "For twenty consecutive years, Erwin has raised coffee and ferns. He has the unconditional support of his wife in his essential economic activity. He is the father of two young people who have become his principal source of inspiration. He is a farmer who is passionate about working in the field and, above all, happy to care for his little plants to then put them up for sale.<br /><br />Erwin has already had a previous experience with the loans from MiCrédito, together with Kiva. Through this support, he bought agricultural supplies for raising coffee. At this time, he is happy to have achieved good production, so much so that he has again turned to the loans from MeCrédito, together with Kiva, to buy compost, minerals, soil refreshers, and foliar sprays.<br /><br />In the not-too-distant future, Don Erwin plans to be the owner a a better nursery and acquire new lands to expand his planting area.",
