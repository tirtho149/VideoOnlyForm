  "Name": "Victor Jairo",
  "description": "Víctor is a humble man, native of the Parish of Julio Andrade, specifically of the community of Santa Clara where he lives with his parents and siblings. His family has always worked in farming. Victor works with love and happiness knowing that this work supports his household. Currently, he cultivates potatoes and fava beans. He also raises dairy cows with help from his parents. Some in the family take care of weeding their crops and covering holes, while others milk and move the cows, and later surround them in order to avoid them being stolen, because thefts have been increasing in neighboring areas. <br />Victor wants to keep improving his crops and dairy cattle in order to generate more profits, because at the moment the price of his farming product has decreased; but he hopes that the situation will improve because he is a man who trusts in God. <br />Victor is requesting a loan to buy seeds, manure, fertilizers, among other farming inputs, and also to buy a calf with the other part of the money.",
