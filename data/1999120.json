  "description": "Many of the women who participate in the Friendship Bridge “Microcredit Plus” program of loans, educational training sessions and health screenings have more than one business. This is true of Victoria who has a fruit orchard (apples, plums, peaches) and also weaves/ embroiders colorful traditional textiles. She is a married 25 year old mother of 2 children (7,9). Victoria uses part of her income for the education of her children. Her husband works alongside her in the orchard and they have 5 employees who are able to support their own families. The fruit is sold in the large municipal market in the lively, large town of Chichicastenango. Victoria is requesting her 4th KIVA loan to buy fertilizer for the orchard.<br /><br /><br /><br />Victoria, along with 6 other Maya K’iche women, is a member of the Trust Bank “Mujeres de Chuchipaca” in the department/state of Quiche. Most of them are farmers or have traditional textile businesses. Most, like Victoria, have 9 years of formal education. They look forward to their monthly meetings when they participate in educational sessions that give them vital information about an aspect of 4 topics: health, family, women, business. Victoria shares that she has found the topic of how to invest her loan to be most useful. Every other month, the ladies have access to health screenings (blood sugar, blood pressure, pap smears).<br /><br /><br /><br />KIVA investors, partnering with Friendship Bridge, play a vital role in the lives of these women. Thank you!",
