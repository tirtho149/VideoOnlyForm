She is very happy being able to support the group. She is content and hard working. She has two children: a boy and a girl.  <br /><br />She sells drinks such as beer, soda and water among other things. Her products are sold from home. Her goal is to have a store to sell drinks and add a small space to buy and sell clothing. <br />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />She also grows and harvests cacao. Her husband helps her with this. He is also a teacher and they both want to advance for their children. <br /><br />Admelia is requesting a loan through Kiva to buy fertilizer for her cacao field so she can provide better products for her clients.",
