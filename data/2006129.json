His farm is 4.21 hectares and 1.4 is dedicated to coffee farming. With the advice he has received from the PAC team, he has implemented the FLO and CAFÉ PRACTICES certifications. <br /><br />For more than 10 years he has made a living by planting and cultivating high quality coffee. For this cycle, Pedro’s challenge is to implement a plan to improve the nutritional health of his coffee plants. This will allow him to increase his family’s income. This loan will allow him to purchase agricultural supplies and to pay for labor to maintain his 1.4 hectares of coffee plants. <br /><br />This is the twelfth loan he is receiving from PAC.",
