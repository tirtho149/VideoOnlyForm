He wants to expand his sales into the markets so that he can sell more to other traders.  <br /><br />Taha hopes to increase his income because his wife will have a baby, so he will need to cover her medical expenses.  He looks forward to having a lovely family and wants to provide a stable life for his wife and child.",
