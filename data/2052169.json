  "description": "More than 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa live without electricity and rely upon harmful fuels for cooking, such as firewood and charcoal. Women disproportionately shoulder the burden of energy poverty. Solar-powered products can improve health, education, and incomes in last mile communities. However, there are challenges to access these households.\n \nSolar Sister recruits, trains, and supports women entrepreneurs to build businesses and bring clean energy products to their last mile communities in Tanzania and Nigeria. The business model elevates African women and puts them at the center of the solution to expand energy access.  Products include solar lamps, solar home systems, and clean cookstoves. An extensive distribution network with deep local expertise allows them to reach the last inch of the last mile. Solar Sister Entrepreneurs report increased autonomy, independence and self-esteem.\n \nSolar Sister has reached over 1.8 million people across Africa with clean energy and supported over 5,000 clean energy entrepreneurs, 86% of whom are female.

This is Solar Sister’s first loan through the Kiva Labs: Social Enterprise program.",
