  "Name": "Carlos Daniel",
  "description": "Daniel lives in the community of Consuelo along with his humble family, formed by his mother and younger brothers, who are field laborers engaged in farming and raising small animals.  From a young age, Daniel learned to work the land, and care for small animals such as guinea pigs, chickens, and pigs as well as till the fields, all thanks to his mother, who went out to work as a day laborer, and she had her animals with which she supported her home.  Thus, today, besides working as a laborer, he is engaged in cultivating potato seeds, a labor that has become an important source of additional income that allows him to support his family.  Daniel wishes to continue expanding his crops for which he is requesting help to buy manure, fertilizers, seeds, and other farm inputs.  In this way, he hopes to take good care of his crops and generate a good production.",
