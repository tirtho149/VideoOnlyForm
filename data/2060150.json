  "description": "This group is in its 43rd loan cycle with the Women’s Committee Program.  The members joined together with a common goal to help their families and provide them a better quality of life.  They are also participating in the poverty elimination program since they are striving to achieve a better quality of life for their families so that they can avoid experiencing hardship.  <br /><br />Sra. Ascención is one of the members.  She helps to support her family through her work of selling plants and cakes.  This enterprising woman does everything she can to secure income that her family needs so that they lack nothing and avoid experiencing hardship.  Ascención says that she joined this group with the goal of accessing training so that she can provide the best for her family, as well as a decent future.  <br /><br />She is requesting a loan to buy compost and fertilizers for her plants, as well as ingredients for making cakes.  This will help to increase her earnings.  Sra. Ascención is very grateful to Kiva and Fundación Paraguaya for helping her group improve their quality of life and that of their families.  <br /><br />Note: The photo shows only one person, even though this is a group loan. It was not possible to take a group photo in order to avoid congregating during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
