  "description": "Danielle is a 36-year-old woman. She lives in Manica province with her family.<br /><br />She has worked in agriculture since she was a young girl. She learned to work in agriculture with her father.<br /><br />When she grew up, she started helping her father with running a business selling seedlings of fruit trees, such as dragon fruit, avocado, orange, lemon, litchi, mango and many more.<br /><br />Danielle manages a lot of greenhouses with many nurseries and seedlings. The business is going very well and her clients' feedback is always positive. As a consequence of Danielle's good services, the demand for her seedlings has been increasing day-by-day and, thus, there is need for a large truck that can help her to easily distribute her products.<br /><br />For this reason, she is requesting a Kiva loan to buy a three ton truck to help her to distribute and sell her seedlings to her clients.",
