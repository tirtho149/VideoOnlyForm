She is 48 years old and married with 4 children.<br /><br />Beatrice likes to think of herself as a very hardworking individual. She has been working alongside One Acre Fund since 2018 and decided to represent her group because she wanted to be more active in her community.

Beatrice plans to use the profits from this upcoming season to send her children to school.<br /><br />In total, Beatrice’s Group will receive inputs to cultivate 3 acres of land.
