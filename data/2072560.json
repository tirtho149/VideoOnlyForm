  "Name": "Jonathan Andres",
  "description": "Andrés is a young man with Colombian roots since his mother is from that country, where work is strong and the charisma to make sales is predominant. Thus, through his mother's teaching, he has acquired the kindness to attend his fruit and vegetable business, an activity that his mother and father have been doing for more than twenty years. From a very young age, Andrés learned this work and today he does it on his own to obtain the income with which he supports his home.<br /><br />Andrés gets up very early every day to sell his products in a local market. He sells his products to consumers by using the pitch \"take these yummy and fresh fruits\".<br /><br />Andrés wants to increase his working capital so he is requesting a loan to buy mangoes, corn, beans, apples, onions, bananas, among other fruits and vegetables. In this way he hopes to further increase his earnings.",
