  "description": "Yainkain K (1st on left), the featured borrower of Women Can Do It! farmers' group, is a master farmer in Sendgu village and has a family of 6 who depend on her. She is passionate about business and farming, and likes to mentor other women in business.<br /><br />Yainkain is a seasoned farmer whose rice farming business was hard hit during Sierra Leone's 2014-2017 Ebola crisis. She has since recovered her business very slowly due to predatory lending and a lack of access to financing. She has organized a large group of other women who, like her, are currently trapped in a cycle of subsistence and take extremely high-interest loans for poor-quality inputs during planting time.<br /><br />A no-interest Kiva loan will enable this group of determined women to throw off the shackles of predatory lending, expand and prosper. Additionally, the global COVID-19 pandemic is causing food shortages in some areas of Sierra Leone as imported rice becomes more scarce. A Kiva loan will empower these women to increase their local rice production and enhance food access in Sierra Leone at a time when this is badly needed.",
