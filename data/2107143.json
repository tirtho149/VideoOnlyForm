  "description": "Luis Carlos is known to be a hard-working man with good values. He dedicates his time to sowing and fishing. His specialty for the last 16 years has been cultivating melons. He can always count on the help of his uncles who motivate him to forge ahead.<br />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />After a previous experience with Kiva and MiCrédito, he has decided to approach them once more to solicit a loan for expanding his melon plantings and, also, to better tend to his crops by buying pesticides and organic manure, in order to achieve a better quality of harvest.<br /><br />Luis's hope for the future is to purchase more land. Then, he will grow a variety of crops, either fruits such as papaya or watermelon, or perhaps basic grains.",
