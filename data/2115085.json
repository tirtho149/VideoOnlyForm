  "description": "Brenda is 24 years old. She began to work in agriculture six years ago, raising principally coffee and basic grains. She did this work when she left her parents' [home] to form her own family. After she separated from her husband, she acquired a job as a teacher, and the salary covered her agricultural expenses. She has 2 manzanas [about 3.5 acres] of coffee that she inherited.<br /><br />She is again applying to FUNDENUSE for a loan with Kiva funds to buy compost and foliar treatments to maintain her coffee crop.<br /><br />With the previous loan, she was able to obtain very good production in her harvests because of the opportune application of the supplies.<br /><br />Her goal is to build her own house and buy lands for planting coffee and expand her property.<br /><br />She belongs to the solidarity group  \"Responsables de linda vista\" along with Keylin and José, who also work in agriculture.",
