  "description": "Pictured above is Dolrose, often described as an extremely hardworking individual. She is 42 years old and has 5 children. As a group leader, she is representing her group of 9 farmers in Alego District, Kenya. <br /><br />Dolrose is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again as she is able to earn enough to feed her family, which is why she decided to join in the first place. Dolrose says that she is happy to have made that decision because, since she first joined in 2016, she has been able to consistently feed her family, which has improved her day-to-day life significantly. Dolrose will use the profits from this season to send her children to school.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 9 acres.",
