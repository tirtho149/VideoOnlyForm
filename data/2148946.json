  "description": "Kelpful is owned and operated by Jules and Melissa. \nMelissa grew up fishing and crabbing on the Chesapeake Bay, helping to feed her family from the ocean. She went on to study politics and social movements at Appalachian State University. After college she had a career in sustainable agriculture, followed by working for a non profit that install's solar on low income housing. Melissa is no stranger to hard work, and is determined to maximize her positive impact on the world. She has come full circle to realize that the best way to do that is to feed people, and that her role is to gather that food from the sea. She couldn't imagine not working in and with the ocean- it's in her blood.  She is deeply committed to bringing sustainably sourced, nutritious food to the table, and sees food as a powerful vehicle for social change. She hopes Kelpful can introduce more people to the benefits of eating seaweed, and grow to include many more worker owners who are equally as passionate about sustainable seafood.\nJules was born and raised on the California Central Coast in Santa Cruz, CA. The ocean is in her blood, growing up surfing and SCUBA diving with an endless curiosity for the depths and passion for the regenerating of these important ecosystems. She studied sustainable engineering, receiving a Civil Engineering degree from the University of Washington and has been working for private engineering firms since. Her passion for sustainable infrastructure extends into her work with Kelpful and goal of running a regenerative ocean farm. Her dream is to captain her own boat (her nickname is already Kaptain Kelp) and manage acres of seaweed species and shellfish thriving in a multi-trophic ecosystem while participating in ocean restoration efforts across the world.",
