  "description": "I’m passionate about coffee and a faithful believer in the great cultural roots of Puerto Rican coffee and its potential for the development of the industry. My love for the culture of Puerto Rico and a passion for entrepreneurship led me to venture into the Puerto Rican Coffee Industry. I began working as a barista at the Museum of Coffee located in Ciales, a small town in the mountains of Puerto Rico. Here, I learned everything I know about coffee: from brewing to roasting and maintaining the quality of a superior cup of coffee. While I was working as a barista in 2017, Hurricane María hit the island destroying most of the coffee harvest. Afterward, I left the country to complete a Master’s degree in Madrid. It was there that nostalgia took hold, and the first thing I began to miss was the coffee from my island. Nostalgia and a drive for creating a business, combined with the lack of access for artisanal coffee brands, gave me the vision, together with my two childhood friends, to create Cuela--a platform that exposes artisan brands of small coffee growers and roasters from Puerto Rico to the local and international market.",
