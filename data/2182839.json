  "description": "Peris, a 42-year-old mom, lives in the beautiful land of Kerugoya, Kenya. She is arguably among the most successful clients of Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance institution that deals only with smallholder farmers in rural parts of Kenya. Her family's main income source is crops, but they are also involved in other agricultural activities such as growing corn.<br /><br />Access to modern-quality farm inputs is the pillar of the agricultural revolution. However, in Kenya, a developing country, fertilizer and seed allocation by the government is way below the needs of farmers. Since Juhudi Kilimo, which is in partnership with Kiva, ventured into the affairs of smallholder farmers in Kenya, farmers can attest that there has been a significant improvement in input availability.<br /><br />Peris is requesting a loan to buy farm inputs such as certified seeds and nutrient-rich fertilizers to improve her corn farming. Your loan will enable her to improve her crop production through the use of quality farm inputs. This intervention will help her meet the increasing demand for food in the market and, in the process, generate more income to repay the loan debt. She also hopes to make improvements to her house.",
