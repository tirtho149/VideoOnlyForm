  "Name": "Bilkisu",
  "description": "Bilkisu lives with his family in an ordinary mud house in a small village in Kano state.  In his community, farming is the primary occupation and like many diligent smallholders, Bilkisu dreams of expanding his farm business.  Due to a lack of access to quality inputs, it has become difficult for farmers like Bilkisu to achieve high yields so as to make a higher income. Luckily, as a Babban Gona member, Bilkisu will because of this loan be provided with higher-yielding seeds that are locally adapted and are widely accepted in his local community. He will also have the recommended pesticides and fertilizers based on the results of his field assessment. This will enable Bilkisu to optimize his yield thereby attaining yields of up to 2 times the national average in Nigeria. He is looking forward to a bountiful harvest with lenders' support to his farming business. Bilkisu plans to use the profits from this season's harvest to access better health facilities for his family.",
