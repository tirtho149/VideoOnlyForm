  "description": "José is a farmer. He arises early to begin his arduous labor.  José is happy in the countryside. He grows beans in shares with a partner, and he has very good support. <br /><br />This farmer has had previous experience with Kiva and MiCrédito, for which he is very grateful - so much so that he is requesting a new loan from these two organizations to buy insecticides, leaf sprays, mulch, and pesticides. His short-term goal is to further diversify his crops.",
