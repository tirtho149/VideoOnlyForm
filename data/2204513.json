  "description": "Anisa was previously employed as a chef in a local hotel. However, with this pandemic, tourism has been tremendously affected, and she made the decision to start her own home-based business. <br /><br />Anisa took a $1000 loan last year (2020) to kick start her canteen and pastry business. Her business flourished, and now Anisa wants to take it a step further. She intends to take a loan of $2500 to start selling kava as well as it is very much in demand.<br /><br />Drinking kava is a favorite pastime in the late afternoon as it is cheap, and, if consumed excessively, drinkers do suffer from a hangover as with alcohol. Having done her homework, she has noticed this to be true for the residents in and around Voua Vou.<br /><br />Anisa hopes that being a businesswoman will help her family financially and show her children that there are more avenues to make money besides being formally employed.",
