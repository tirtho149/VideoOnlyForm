  "description": "Yeabu T (pictured first on the right), is the featured borrower of Yeabu's Female Farmers. She is a master farmer in Masagble village and has a large family of six. She is passionate about business and farming and likes to help younger women get their start.<br /><br />Yeabu is a seasoned farmer whose rice farming business was hard hit during Sierra Leone's 2014-2017 Ebola crisis. She has since recovered her business very slowly due to predatory lending and a lack of access to financing. She has organized a large group of other women who, like her, are currently trapped in a cycle of subsistence and take extremely high-interest loans for poor-quality inputs during planting time. A no-interest Kiva loan will enable this group of determined women to throw off the shackles of predatory lending, expand, and prosper.<br /><br />Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic is causing food shortages in some areas of Sierra Leone as imported rice becomes more scarce. A Kiva loan will empower these women to increase their local rice production and enhance food access in Sierra Leone at a time when it is badly needed.",
