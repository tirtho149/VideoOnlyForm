  "description": "Roque is a small-scale farmer with seven years of experience in agriculture.  He learned this trade by working the land at a very young age.  His father also gave him some land on which he decided to grow coffee.  At the moment, he has six parcels of coffee and the land needs to be prepared to provide better conditions.  <br /><br />For this reason, Roque is requesting a Kiva loan from MiCrédito to buy compost, soil refreshers, and pesticides to apply to his crops in order to secure a good harvest.  In the near future, he wants to continue acquiring more land and begin planting cacao.",
