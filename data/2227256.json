  "description": "Get to know Mary, a zealous mother who works on her mixed farm! Converting her idea of starting a farm into a reality was the biggest achievement that she has ever made in her life. She has made meaningful accomplishments in life through farming, including sending her children to school. Mary has been a mixed farmer for ten years, rearing dairy cows and growing different crops.<br /><br />Mary is humbly seeking a loan to buy farm inputs such as seeds, high nutrient fertilizers and pesticides in order to grow more crops, and then to use the profits from her farm to improve the living conditions of her children.<br /><br />This intervention will help her to fill the increasing demand for food in the market and, in the process, generate more income to repay the loan debt and improve the quality of life for her family. She hopes to improve the condition of her house. Help this always-smiling and happy mother to accomplish all her dreams with a loan!",
