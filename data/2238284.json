  "description": "Gheorghe is a 62-year-old man from Bahmut village, in the Calarasi region of Moldova. He is married and lives with his wife in his own house. His wife cares for the home even though she has small health problems. Thus, Gheorghe is the only worker in the family. <br /><br />Gheorghe works in his native village as an excavator. He is a good professional and does his job every day with a lot of dedication. When the weather is rainy, he does not work. That is why his salary varies every month. To occupy his free time and be able to obtain extra income, Gheorghe decided to start producing honey. He plans to increase the capacity of his business and earn income from the production of honey and bee products.<br /><br />Gheorghe has old hives in the yard and now he wants to buy 10 new hives and bee families. Not having enough money, Gheorghe decided to apply for a loan from Kiva sources. As a result, he will be able to grow his desired business and provide his family with a source of natural honey and a better future.",
