  "Name": "Zubairu",
  "description": "Zubairu is a maize farmer from the rural area of Kaduna, a state in northern Nigeria, who wants to boost his farming earnings. He gets access to high-quality inputs and increased farming services as a member of Babban Gona, which enables him to increase his yields. <br /><br />Zubairu is now farming more sustainably as a result of training programs. His fertilizer training, for example, focuses on micro-dosing fertilizers to reduce their environmental impact while increasing yields. Zubairu anticipates 35 bags/hectare from this year's harvest, more than double the national Nigerian average of 18 bags/hectare.<br /><br />Zubairu needs a Harvest Advance loan to purchase a motorcycle and establish a transportation business. He will receive the cash equivalent of the harvested maize through the harvest advance loan. Babban Gona will then assist in storing his maize and selling it at a higher price in the future, generating more returns. This is favorable to Zubairu as he intends to use the proceeds from this harvest to purchase a motorcycle.",
