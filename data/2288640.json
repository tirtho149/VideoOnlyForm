  "description": "Because cacao is a seasonal crop, the required capital to run a processing facility dramatically spikes at the beginning of the cocoa harvest season. At the end of the harvest season, farmer members of ADEMAYACH invest in the cacao processing facility or provide inputs for farmer members of the association and share any remaining profit equally.\n\nCacao Verapaz, the cacao buyer, offers working capital financing from Kiva to ADEMAYACH at the beginning of the season so that cacao can be purchased upfront, and farmers can be paid on delivery. When the association sells to Cacao Verapaz, they repay the working capital loan. ADEMAYACH is excited to be bringing additional certified organic farmers into their association, so they anticipate producing extra volume this year. Although 2021 has been a tough year for the harvest, ETA and IOTA storms hurt the crop, and the reduction compared to 2020 was more than 50%; 2022 is looking better, and the association board wants to have working capital to buy as much cacao as possible.",
