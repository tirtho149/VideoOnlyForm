  "description": "Kipkoeech  has a passion for producing quality dairy products, especially milk. He lives in Kericho with 5 family members. He is buying a Sistema Biobolsa biodigester to reduce the costs of his business and to improve crop yields in order to save money for his family.<br /><br />Kipkoeech finds himself spending a lot of money on non-renewable LP gas due to the heat required in the milk production process. By using the biogas generated by his 20 cubic meters Sistema Biobolsa biodigester, he will decrease both his costs and his carbon footprint. The same cow manure used to produce the biogas, will also produce a potent biofertilizer to use on his vegetable crops.<br /><br />This loan represents 89% of the price of the biodigester; the remaining part is paid directly by Kipkoeech.",
