  "description": "Martha (born in 1980) is a progressive single woman and mother of three of whom two are school-going children. She lives with her children in a remote area of Eldoret. For the past ten years, she has been entirely dependent on profits from her farm to take care of her family, but she is a focused woman who always thinks of success. So during these years, Martha has been growing maize and keeping dairy cows. Through these activities, she has been able to earn a decent and honest income.<br /><br />When Martha learned about Juhudi and Kiva from a Juhudi Kilimo loan officer, she became interested in the good work that Kiva does to support smallholder farmers. She is happy to have access to reliable microfinance institutions, and she attended regular training sessions to learn about savings and loans.<br /><br />The main challenge this enterprising woman has often mentioned is the high cost of farming inputs in her area. Therefore, Martha is obtaining this loan to buy farming inputs such as high-nutrient fertilizers and certified maize seeds to improve her farm’s yield and make more in profits to support her family.<br /><br />Lenders, if you wish to support a borrower, think of Martha; she will not let you down.",
