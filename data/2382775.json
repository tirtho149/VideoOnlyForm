  "description": "Sophal is a farmer who grows rice, cashew and cassava. Faming is very important for him and his family. Currently he spends about $300 per year on chemical fertilizer. He worries about the quality of the soil because chemical fertilizer could make the soil quality worse. <br /><br />He wants to use natural fertilizer so he decided to buy a biodigester because it not only produces  gas for cooking but also produces good fertilizer for the soil. <br /><br />He is requesting a loan to buy a biodigester because he wants to improve the quality of his soil and reduce his fertilizer costs.",
