In addition to expanding her business and having her shop, Altantsetseg is also working to introduce national products to the region and foreign tourists.<br /><br />She will use this loan to open her shop. By having an Altantsetseg boutique store counter, she will not only increase her profits but will also be able to deliver her brand of organic products to more people.",
