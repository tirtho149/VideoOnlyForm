  "description": "Erdenesuren is a single mother and female entrepreneur. She is 49 years old and lives with her 15-year-old daughter. She is very hardworking, gentle, calm, and thorough. <br /><br />After Erdenesuren gave birth to her daughter, her family faced financial difficulties, so she decided to start a business. She had no idea what she wanted to do. Based on her thinking, she decided to engage in animal husbandry. Her parents were cattle ranchers, so she had a lot of knowledge and experience in the business, so there were few difficulties for her. <br /><br />She raises cows and sells dairy products made from cows' milk. Erdenesuren has already been doing this business for five years, during which time she has established many regular customers and traders who supply raw materials. She aims to serve people with healthy products, so she does not use any chemical additives in her dairy products. <br /><br />Erdenesuren plans to increase her herd of cows and the variety of dairy products produced. Also, her daughter is soon starting college, because she works diligently all day to ensure her daughter gets a quality education.<br /><br />This winter has been freezing, and there is a shortage of feed. As a result, her cows' milk production has also drastically decreased. Therefore, Erdenesuren decided to take a loan. She will use this loan to purchase milk as a raw material for animal feed and dairy production.",
