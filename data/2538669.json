  "description": "Onesmus lives in Meru. Like many farmers in his region, he used to buy firewood to power his farm, but this has become a problem. Now trees are scarce, making it even more difficult for farmers to have affordable access to energy. <br /><br />Onesmus plans to use a Sistema Biobolsa biodigester to eliminate wood, fossil fuels, and chemical fertilizers from his farm. With his 12 cubic meter of Sistema Biobolsa, he will transform his cow's manure into renewable energy and organic fertilizer. He and his family will be able to cook without smoke and stop spending time chopping wood. <br /><br />Onesmus ’s family will also increase the vegetable productivity with the organic fertilizer that the biodigester will produce and give back to the soil the nutrients needed to reforest Meru. This loan represents 100% of the price of the biodigester.\"",
