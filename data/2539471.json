  "description": "Chepchirchir was bothered by the rate at which her kitchen was getting black from smoke soothe. “If the wall can get this dark in a few months, how much darker are my lungs from a lifetime of inhaling firewood smoke?”- Chepchirchir  pointed out.<br /><br />Just like her neighbors, her family had to spend a lot of time fetching the limited firewood on their farm, a move that would later be dangerous for families, especially for women and children who spend long hours in the kitchen cooking for their families.<br /><br />As a wife and a mother, she decided to confront the problem by purchasing a Sistema.bio digester. She wants to enjoy a healthy cooking experience and she also  wants to begin a journey building generations of sustainable communities in Bomet. She wants that her children never have to cook with smoke again. With the digester, Chepchirchir will transform 3 cows manure into energy.<br /><br />This loan represents 100% of the full price of the bio-digester.",
