  "description": "Tuğçe is a 35-year-old high school graduate entrepreneur from Muğla. She moved from Istanbul to Marmaris 20 years ago with her family due to the harsh living conditions.<br /><br />She worked in a store in her first years and then switched to the marine sector. But Tuğçe needed an income in the winter and started to make organic foods with her mother and brother. They needed capital to start making and selling products such as eggs, kefir, chili powder, yogurt, yeast, and vegetables.<br /><br />Tuğçe met with TGMP's microcredit at that time and benefited from it in 2019.<br /><br />With her Kiva microcredit, Tuğçe will buy more supplies to produce more organic food.",
