  "description": "Anneta  plans to use a Sistema Biobolsa biodigester to eliminate wood, fossil fuel and chemical fertilizer from her farm. She lives in Meru with 5 family members including parents. She supports her family with income from her 5 cows and from her annual vegetable yield.<br /><br />Anneta wastes time chopping wood to burn for cooking and heating bathwater and also worries about the air quality for her family. With the biodigester she will transform her cows' manure into renewable energy (biogas) and organic fertilizer. <br /><br />As she starts putting the animal waste into the biodigester, bacteria will convert it into both biogas for cooking and nutrient-rich fertilizer that Anneta will apply on her vegetable field. All of this will enable her to increase her yield, eliminate the need to chop wood, and use the money she used to spend on fossil fuel and chemical fertilizer to invest in buying additional cows.<br /><br />With this Kiva loan Anneta  will realize her dream of making her farm economically and environmentally sustainable in order to continue the generations-old tradition of farming in Meru.<br /><br />This loan represents 100% of the price of the biodigester. \"",
