  "description": "Good day, lenders! Meet one of KBMI’s clients, Darniti. She is thirty-eight years old and married with two sons and three daughters. Darniti runs a business cultivating seaweed to earn money for her family. She has been running this business for more than ten years, and it has made great contributions to the life of her family, helping to cover not only their daily needs, but also her children's educational needs. <br /><br />She has applied for a loan of 10,000,000 Indonesian rupiahs (IDR) from KBMI to get additional capital to buy more seaweed to cultivate to expand her business. Her income is not sufficient to buy the seaweed outright, but she will be able to repay the loan received.<br /><br />Darniti is a very hardworking mother who always strives for the best for her children, to improve their living conditions and create a happy life for them. She is very grateful for the opportunity and wants to thank all lenders.",
