  "description": "Wasiur is a farmer living in Feni, Bangladesh, with five members of his family. He runs his own homestead farm and has a small parcel of land used to earn the livelihood for the family. <br /><br />He is well-known among his fellows for his hardworking nature in farming cattle and land where he grows green vegetables.<br /><br />Wasiur wants to buy a biodigester because he wants to produce organic vegetables to sell in the market. The biodigester will convert animal manure into a bio gas for use in daily cooking and organic fertilizer for farming.<br /><br />Having a loan to buy a biodigester to obtain cheaper solutions of biogas and fertilizers will save Wasiur a great deal of money and time for cooking fuel and organic fertilizers. <br /><br />That will in turn boost his farming activities.",
