  "description": "Rony, 27, lives in the community of Moral with his partner and their 2 children.  The family lives in a small house owned by a relative that has been lent to them, so that they do not have to pay for a rental.  <br /><br />Upon becoming a father and having the responsibility of providing for the well-being of his family, Rony looked for a way to support the household.  With some initial savings, he started to cultivate potatoes, and this activity has given him a good income.  This is why Rony has decided to continue with this type of work and expand his production.  However, to do this, he needs a bigger investment of capital.  This is why he is requesting a loan to buy seeds, chemical and organic fertilizers, and other agricultural supplies.  In this way, he hope to improve his farming activity so that he can generate more profits.",
