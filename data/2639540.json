Her school fees are paid from the business income. Some of the women in their village buy the mulberries from them. It is a good source of income for Unaloto. <br /><br />In the future, she is hoping to learn the skills of making tapas, so she can join a group and make tapas. Unaloto applied for this loan to buy chemicals and fertilizers for their plantation.",
