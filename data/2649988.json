  "description": "Six years ago, 15 women decided to do something to help their families and community generate income. With a decreasing number of employment opportunities and knowing that they live in a fertile valley with many trees, diverse plantations and flowers, they decided to jump into the beekeeping business. Their sight was set on the possibility of selling honey and honey-based products. They attended many workshops on beekeeping and production of honey to be ready to start their community bank oriented around honey production. <br /><br /><br /><br />Superacion in English means \"to overcome\" and as their name suggests, they have overcome so many stigmas toward female empowerment and business ownership. Being a primarily female community-owned bank, this is Superacion Community-Owned Bank's third loan with us. They have continually proven that they are more than capable. Having a successful client base, they are embarking on the use of honey for cosmetic purposes and have so far succeeded. <br /><br /><br /><br />This time, Superacion Community-Owned Bank is seeking a loan to purchase more hives in order to meet the need for raw material to supply for their new products. Growing this new business line will create employment opportunities for the community members which are confident after seeing the acceptance of 100% natural honey-based hair and skin care products. <br /><br /><br /><br />Join us today and be part of this group of empowered women. Featured here are some of the community bank members.",
