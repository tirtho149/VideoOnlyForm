  "description": "Luis is a humble man of 76 years of age. Despite his disability of the left arm, he is very active and has managed to build a better life for his family. They live together in a house that they build themselves with a lot of effort. Luis earns a living by growing sugar cane, which he sells in the area as a food supplement for cattle. It is important to note that his farm and his produce are organic. He has big projects in mind, which is why he asks for a loan not only to keep tending to his crops, but also to start rearing red tilapia fish. His goal is to make his dream of building a real family business around the farm come true in the near future. This way, all members of the family will have a better future, especially his grandchildren, who still go to school.",
