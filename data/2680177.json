  "description": "I have been in the farming industry for over a decade, starting my journey\r\nby keeping bees part-time while working as an environmental scientist in\r\nTexas. My passion for sustainable land stewardship led me to transition to\r\nsustainable agriculture and relocate to Central Arkansas. During this time,\r\nI managed organic vegetable production, conducted research, and hosted\r\nworkshops for a large non-profit organization. As I learned more about\r\nsustainable farming, I realized its potential to not only reduce\r\nenvironmental harm but also reverse it, healing the land. While working\r\nwith farmers across Arkansas, I observed the significant obstacles they\r\nfaced, including the lack of affordable, regionally available, and\r\nscale-appropriate tools and supplies. This realization fueled my dedication\r\nto improving the lives of growers and lowering the barriers to entry into\r\nsmall-scale sustainable agriculture, which eventually led me to start\r\nMindful Farmer.\r\n\r\nMindful Farmer specializes in designing and manufacturing tools, high\r\ntunnels, and supplies for small-scale sustainable gardeners and farmers. We\r\nare committed to delivering heirloom-quality, regionally manufactured tools\r\nthat prioritize efficiency and ergonomics. In addition, we offer economical\r\nhigh tunnels and a wide selection of organic soil amendments. At our core,\r\nwe aim to empower growers with the essential tools, supplies, and knowledge\r\nthey need to thrive, thereby lowering the barriers to entry into farming.",
