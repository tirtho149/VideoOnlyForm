  "description": "Vilimaina is a familiar face at her local market, selling fruits, vegetables and few ready-to-wear clothes and tote bags with a smile on her face every day. She is now hoping to obtain a loan to help her business continue to operate, as she needs to support her small family of 4. Laisani humbly seeks a loan to buy seedlings, soil manure and rolls of fabrics to continue serving her customers. She is adamant on using her profits earned to send her children to school and eventually renovate her home.",
