  "description": "Justin is a 34-year-old lady married with 3 children who are all going to school. She is a resident of Kagoma and a coffee farmer who has been in this activity for some time.<br /><br />Coffee farming has enabled her to supplement her family's income, however she has a challenge of low yields due to soil erosion, pests that attach to coffee, and loss of fertility of the soil. She has requested funds to buy mulches, manure, fertilizers and pesticides.<br /><br />This will help her improve on her yields hence improving earnings.<br /><br />Thank you funders.",
