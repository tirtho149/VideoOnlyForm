After six years of volunteering and two years learning the art of roasting coffee and bar management, I was able to open Filtrado.\r\n\r\nNow the bar is closed for reasons out of our control. But we got a new and bigger space to reopen. Filtrado's team want to welcome all our community again, craft more coffee and make you smile",
