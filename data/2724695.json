Marcos lives alongside his family in Caserío Chuiatzam.<br /><br />Several years ago, he started his business in banana production. He feels grateful because, during the time he has been working in this business, he has been able to make a living for his family through the profits he earns. For this reason, he gets up every day feeling happy and enthusiastic. <br /><br />One of Marcos' goals is to tend to and maintain his banana product, which is why he decided to apply for a loan to invest in the purchase of agricultural inputs such as compost and insecticides. This will help him continue giving his best in his business and, most importantly, it will help him to have a good-quality product for his customers.",
