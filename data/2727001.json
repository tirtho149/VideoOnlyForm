  "description": "Hillary is from Kyaburere parish, Bugangari subcounty.  He is a repeat client with Ugafode.  He deals in banana and coffee farming.  Unfortunately, Hillary is challenged with not having enough working capital to buy Agro-inputs, such as mulches and manure.  These inputs would improve his plantation productivity and therefore increase his production and sales, allowing him to generate more income.  <br /><br />Hillary is requesting a loan to buy those Agro-inputs to enhance his plantations.  He is thankful to Ugafode and Kiva for the support,",
