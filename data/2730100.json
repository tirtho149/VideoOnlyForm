  "description": "Meet Ulziikhishig, a 37-year-old diligent woman. She has been running a business in the agricultural industry with her husband for almost 5 years. They have three children. <br /><br />Ulziikhishig usually grows potatoes and supplies them to the market. People tend to purchase groceries that are planted in the country rather than imported vegetables. They do not use any chemicals in the planting which is why there is a demand. <br /><br />What Ulziikhishig likes about her business is looking at the outcome after trying hard. With your generosity, she will buy sacks for sorting out potatoes and spend it for delivery service.",
