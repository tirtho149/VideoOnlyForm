He would like to invest in sustainable orchid farming.<br /><br />Danai has been selling through NOVICA since 2003. This is his story:<br /><br />\"I was born in northern Thailand. After going to college, my partner's father suggested that we create something representative of the area where we live and we came up with the idea of covering natural products, such as exotic flowers and plants, with gold.\"<br /><br />\"Our orchid jewelry relies on seasonal blooms, but rising greenhouse costs threaten orchid growers. We need your support to help continue preserving this unique craft and the beauty in our jewelry.\"<br /><br />Use the link below to view Danai's jewelry featuring natural flowers on the NOVICA site:<br /><br />http://www.novica.com/kiva/4076/",
