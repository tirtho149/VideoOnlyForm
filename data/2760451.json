  "description": "Sanai is an artisan from Thailand who specializes in wood tableware and home décor. He would like to invest in a bulk purchase of wood.<br /><br />Sanai has been selling through NOVICA since 2018. This is his story:<br /><br />\"In 2008, my family and I moved to Chiang Mai and bought a small piece of land not far from the city. Most people in our community work in the wood furniture industry. I got my start in woodworking by carving a piece of discarded wood into a bowl shape. I realized I enjoyed wood carving and began to learn by helping people around my community. I found that there was so much wood waste from furniture processing, so I used it to make useful items. I also like to use wood from old houses or even pigsties, because I believe that every place has history and memories. I do not paint my woodwork because I want each piece to be unique.\"<br /><br />\"Recent changes to Thailand's export regulations for wooden handicrafts have increased our costs and impacted our sales. This microcredit will be incredibly helpful, allowing me to get a better price for high quality wood. Thank you for your support.\"<br /><br />Use the link below to view Sanai's teak wood tableware and home décor on the NOVICA site:<br /><br />http://www.novica.com/kiva/12671/",
