  "description": "Justiniano is a senior farmer from Rosas, Cauca, with over 49 years of experience. He owns a two-hectare farm that he bought over 30 years ago, where he tends to more than 2,000 coffee plants along with sugarcane crops, which he harvests every two weeks, collecting over half a ton of each. Justiniano uses the sugarcane to produce panela (a natural sweetener made from sugarcane juice), which has allowed him to secure a fixed contract with a panela supplier.<br /><br />Justiniano lives in a house he built near his farm to supervise his crops.<br /><br />A loan of $3,632,822 COP allows Justiniano to purchase organic fertilizers rich in phosphate, which will fortify his soil and enhance sustainable growth in his crops.",
