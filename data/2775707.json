As well as this he also plants corn and beans but coffee is what he mainly grows to earn an income for his family. <br />Marlon José dreams of having his ideal farm. He’s been involved in farming work from a very early age along side his parents from whom with a lot of effort and dedication he learnt to work the land. <br />This year he’s asking for a loan to be invested in buying supplies such as calcium, boron and zinc so he can take care of his coffee crop. <br />This season he will employ 15 people from his community. This is the first loan he is arranging with PACSA.",
