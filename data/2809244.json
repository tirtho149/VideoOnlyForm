She grows bananas and sells them in the market. She earns a monthly household income of INR. 25,000. Her banana cultivation business is her main source of income for her family. She is a hardworking woman who wants to expand her banana business. <br /><br />Radha is planning to increase the output of bananas in her plot of land. She plans on purchasing banana saplings, manure, and pesticides to expand her banana cultivation business. However, her monthly household income is not enough to meet the needs of their family and bear these costs. Therefore, she has applied for a collective loan of INR.120,000 from WeGrow, one of Milaap's field partners. <br /><br />Radha leads a group of three women. All of them are engaged in income-generating activities and need a loan to expand their businesses. This will help them cover the costs of the farm supplies and cultivate bananas on a large scale. Radha and her friends and their families will be grateful for the support.",
