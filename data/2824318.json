  "description": "Thomas, as many coffee farmers, is very curious.  They are continuously searching and innovating to decrease production costs, buy at the same time ensure the best coffee quality production. <br /><br />Thomas saw that his neighbors installed a Sistema.bio digester in their farms and he saw how the biodigester was making amazing changes in their crops.  The cow manure was transformed into a very potent and organic fertilizer and biogas (clean and renewable energy) through the biodigester. <br /><br />Thomas wants to buy his own biodigester to reduce his reliance on expensive and non-renewable agrochemical fertilizers to increase the quality of his vegetables, processing the manure from his cows, helping both his wallet and the environment.<br /><br />This loan represents 100% of the price of the biodigester.",
