  "description": "This season is not the first one that Hellen is working alongside One Acre Fund. She has been a member for a few years now, having joined the program in 2015. Although she is the only person featured in the above picture (others in the group were unavailable during profile collections), she is actually representing her group of 13 farmers in Mukhonje Duka Zone District, Kenya.<br /><br />Hellen is often described by her community as a very hardworking individual, She decided to be the one to represent her group because she wanted to help more farmers. Like many of her fellow farmers, Hellen decided she wanted to be part of the One Acre Fund community in order to earn enough to feed her family. She hopes to use the profits from this year’s harvest to send her children to school.<br /><br />This loan will not only help Hellen but the whole group, who will receive maize seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 7.56 acres of land.",
