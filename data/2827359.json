  "Name": "Malezi's Group",
  "description": "This season is not the first time that Malezi has worked alongside One Acre Fund.  He has been a member for a few years now, having joined the program in 2012.  Even though he is the only person featured in the photo, he is actually representing a group of 11 farmers from Lukusi Duka Zone District, Kenya.  The other group members were unavailable during the profile collections.<br /><br />Malezi is often described in his community as a very experienced farmer.  He decided to be the one to represent his group because he wanted to help more farmers.  Like many of his fellow farmers, Malezi decided he wanted to be part of the One Acre Fund community in order to obtain the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  He hopes to use the profits from this year’s harvest to save more money for the future.<br /><br />This loan will not only help Malezi, but the entire group.  They will receive maize seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 5.37 acres of land.<br /><br />Malezi is holding a solar light that was purchased previously using a Kiva loan.",
