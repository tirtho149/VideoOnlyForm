  "description": "Lawrence has a passion for producing quality dairy products, especially milk. He lives in South Rift with three family members. He is buying a Sistema Biobolsa biodigester to reduce the costs of his business and to improve crop yields in order to save money for his family.<br /><br />Lawrence finds himself spending a lot of money on non-renewable LP gas due to the heat required in the milk production process. By using the biogas generated by his 12-cubic-meter Sistema Biobolsa biodigester, he will decrease both his costs and his carbon footprint. The same cow manure used to produce the biogas will also produce a potent biofertilizer to use on his vegetable crops.<br /><br />This loan represents 100% of the price of the biodigester.",
