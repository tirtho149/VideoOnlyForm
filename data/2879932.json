  "description": "Mercy is an ambitious farmer who wants to turn her farm into a model for sustainable, small-scale farms. <br /><br />She has decided to invest in a Sistema Biobolsa biodigester in order to treat the manure from her cows and transform it into renewable energy (biogas) and nutrient-rich organic fertilizer to make her farm more productive. <br /><br />In fact, Mercy used to pile up her cow manure waste on her farm where it was emitting greenhouse gases and contaminating the environment. <br /><br />Through her investment in a biodigester, instead of spending on LP gas and chemical fertilizers, Mercy will be able to invest in the expansion of her farm. Mercy's goal is to purchase more cows and increase her vegetable production. <br /><br />Her farm will become more cost-effective and sustainable as she starts applying the fertilizer from the biodigester to nourish the soil in an entirely organic and environmentally friendly manner. She looks forward to transforming a problem into a solution and to show that waste actually is a resource!<br /><br />This loan represents 100% of the price of the biodigester.",
