  "description": "This loan will help Gudelio purchase a new tractor to increase his farm's productivity.\n\nAs a young man, Gudelio traveled every week to the central market in Mexico City and sold his family’s produce. He married,had four children, and continued to work on his family's farm. However, as his family grew, his income as a farmer in Mexico did not. Needing to provide for his family, Gudelio moved to New York City alone in 2001. Although he worked any job he could find for the first couple years in the States, his passion remained in the fields and he began looking for ways to tap into the farming market in New York State. Gudelio decided to invest his savings to lease a one-acre plot of land in Staten Island and he began cultivating what he knew: poblano peppers and herbs. Although this produce was uncommon in New York City, it was not unpopular. Gudelio wired most of his earnings to his family in Mexico. \n\nNow, years later, Gudelio leases multiple acres of land throughout New York, runs his own Community Shared Agriculture (CSA) program — El Poblano Farm (http://www.elpoblanofarm.com/), and supports his children who are now attending college in the States. \n\nThe popularity of Gudelio’s produce is soaring, and he is looking for a loan to purchase a tractor to help him keep up with the demand.",
