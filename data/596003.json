  "description": "Elibariki, a dairy farmer in Tanzania, is constantly looking to reduce his operational costs on daily bases. His cows produce sufficient milk even suitable for starting a small yogurt and cheese business. But he cannot think of these ideas due to the high cost of energy required. With the installation of 6 cubic meter biodigester, Elibariki will be able to generate clean-burning, renewable biogas from the several kilograms of manure his cows produce weekly, allowing him to significantly decrease his energy costs. Moreover, he will use the fertilizer generated by the system on his animal feed – plants remaining - allowing him to save on agrochemical fertilizer costs. This TAHUDE Foundation biodigester initiative has so much impressed Elibariki such that beside his own biodigester, he has decided to build one more biodigester for his parents. TAHUDE Foundation is grateful and appreciates his enthusiasm. His success will impact not only his family and parents but the community at large.",
