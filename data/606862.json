  "Name": "Rigoberto",
  "description": "Rigoberto, 53, went to school through sixth grade. He has been married for 36 years, and his wife works in the home. Their three children no longer live with them, but a foster daughter and a granddaughter do.\r\n\r\nHe is a farmer and shopkeeper with 12 years experience in traveling to sell fruits and vegetables. He also has 5 years experience of running his own shop from his home. He learned these skills on his own and decided to work in this sector because he doesn't earn much from farming. He developed his work himself and is going to sell every day in the mornings. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting this loan to buy rice, oil, sweets, and other basic necessity items. This will help him have a better income and satisfy the purchasing demand in the community so people don't have to go far to shop.\r\n\r\nHis goal is to open a stall in his town's market so he doesn't have to go far from his home to sell anymore. Rigoberto wants his family to have a decent life and he wants them to learn to work hard and be good people. He will also invest part of the loan into repairing his home, since he wasn't able to finish this project, due to a lack of money. This will give his family more space.",
