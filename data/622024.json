  "description": "Tural is 24 years old. He works and lives with his mother. Now he works as a guard in the irrigation department. Additionally he takes up crop farming, like his fellow villagers do. Most of the local population have engaged in farming and animal husbandry. \r\n\r\nWith his savings, Tural purchased a 1 hectare plot of land and sows barley, wheat, sugar beet and grass there. In order to fulfill his goal, he is taking a loan to buy a tractor. He hopes his work will not be without rewards and that next year, he will receive a bountiful harvest. Thanks to the loan, he will have an additional source of income, which will help him greatly improve his and his mother 's life and surely to get ready for marriage. ",
