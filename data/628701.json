  "Name": "Rubén Eliseo",
  "description": "Rubén, 32, finished high school in the city. He had to get up at 5:00 a.m. to reach his destination. At that time, he was in a formal relationship that produced a son, who is now six, in kindergarten, and depends on his father. Rubén has been president of his community's Adesco for three years and is a good leader. He works hard farming and growing fruit and ornamental plants. \r\n\r\nBesides farming and growing plants, he has been selling silk hammocks for a year and has been an electrician for 14 years. He says he learned the trade from his parents. He does a variety of jobs because some of these businesses are seasonal, but this strategy provides continuous work. He works as an electrician in his neighborhood and in surrounding areas. He sells hammocks at the side of the highway so that motorists can see the merchandise he makes. \r\n\r\nHe has applied for a loan to buy a case of silk thread to weave hammocks and to pay personal expenses. He wants to have a variety of merchandise available to sell to customers during the upcoming holiday season, a good time for business. He hopes to grow his hammock business, which would create local jobs and allow him to develop personally. He also wants to improve his financial situation so that he can help his son get an education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
