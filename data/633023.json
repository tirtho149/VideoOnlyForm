  "Name": "Severo",
  "description": "Severo, together with a group of people from the same community decided to care for the land and animals ecologically in order to obtain cheese with a nutritive content high in calcium, proteins and phosphorous. At the same time they will counteract the nutritional problems from milk that has a high level of saturated fat, triglycerides and saturated fatty acid. Their first step was to not tie up their cows nor keep them penned up far from the places they like to pasture. Neither would they cut off their horns so that they can birth calves naturally. Moreover they would give the animals fresh, high quality feed. \r\n\r\nSevero lives in his own house located in the community of Achica Baja, in the municipality of Viacha in Ingavi province in the department of La Paz, an approximately two hours journey from the city of La Paz.\r\n\r\nSevero needs the loan to purchase a pair of improved breed milk cows so that he can use their milk to produce ecological cheese. \r\n\r\nSevero’s dream is to expand and in the medium term to have his own ecological farm which will be self-sustaining principally through Biodigesters and Biogas. To do this,  he requires livestock that will provide at least 12 kilos of manure daily, which, mixed with 60 liters of water will provide methane for four hours a day, thus avoiding the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) in order to care for the environment. This is the third time he has applied for credit from IMPRO and the first time from KIVA,\r\n",
