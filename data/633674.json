  "description": "Sonia works baking bread, and together with a group of people from her community, she decided to care for the land and raise animals to produce organic cheese. She says that the cheese is very nutritious and high in calcium, protein and phosphorous, which offsets its high content of saturated fat and triglycerides. \r\n\r\nOne of the first steps Sonia took to ensure that the cows bear their calves naturally and produce milk that is fresh and high-quality, was not to tie up the cows or keep them in pens far from the pastures where they like to graze. She also does not cut their horns.\r\n\r\nSonia lives in her own home, which is in the community of Achica Baja, in the Viacha sector of the province of Ingavi, in the department of La Paz, which is about two hours from the city of La Paz.\r\n\r\nSonia says that her dream is to expand in the medium-term future, and to have her own organic farm, which will be self-sustaining and operated primarily with biogas produced by biodigesters. Sonia says that this process requires enough livestock to produce at least 12 kilograms of manure each day. When the manure is mixed with 60 liters of water, it can supply four hours of methane gas daily. This avoids the release of carbon dioxide, which helps care for the environment.\r\n\r\nSonia is requesting this loan to buy flour, which she says she needs very much to improve her work because she uses a biodigester in her bakery.\r\n\r\nThis is Sonia’s third loan with the field partner and the first loan with Kiva.",
