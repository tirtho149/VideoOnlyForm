  "description": "Crisantos Javier is 46 years old, and he has three young children that are still under his care. Originally from the town of Chinandega, Crisantos sells his services transporting heavy cargo. He is the owner of two trucks, which he uses to transport crops of peanuts, sugar cane, as well as the crops from farmers in the western areas. \r\n\r\nCrisantos also makes private trips, working with fixed clients, and sometimes for occasional clients. He knows about this business because of his work as an assistant, then he worked in his own vehicle. Bit by bit his business grew until he got two large trucks. \r\n\r\nOne of Crisantos's dreams is to be able to see his sons grown up and transformed into professionals, as he did not even make it to high school. Another dream of his is to keep expanding his business. The objective of this loan is to purchase two new tires for his work units, thus ensuring the smooth running of his units to clients.",
