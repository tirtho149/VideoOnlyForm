  "Name": "José Raymundo",
  "description": "José, 34, only has a basic education.  He is married and his wife is a homemaker and cares for the children.  José currently works as a truck and urban bus driver.  He also grows corn on a half acre of land for family consumption and takes care of two cows.  His children are small and the eldest is the only one who goes to school.  The second will begin elementary next year.\r\n\r\nJosé will be starting the sugar harvest season and will be driving a trailer taking sugar from the factory to the distribution centers.  He has been involved in this work for 16 consecutive years so he has much experience; but this work only lasts around six months in the summer or until the sugar cane harvest in the eastern part of the country is over.  After that, José works as an urban public transportation driver in the city.  He was given the opportunity 20 years ago to learn how to drive buses and trucks so now that is the main source of income for the family.  His workplace is 4 kilometers from home so he must get up very early in the morning to go to work.\r\n\r\nHe will use the loan to buy a pick up truck to sell fruits and vegetables after the harvest season.  He prefers not to work with buses now because of the high crime rate in this sector now.  He plans to go into the new business because he is familiar with it and it will be a good way to provide for his family.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to have a safe, stable, profitable job after the sugar cane season; because as long as he is working on the harvest he earns a good income with no problems.  He even earns double pay for overtime.  When the harvest is over he can buy and sell fruits and vegetables to improve his family's living conditions, improve the house, give his children an education and resolve the problem without limitations.\r\n",
