  "description": "Mahbuba is an industrious woman. She is a married parent of three children. One of her children is not an adult. Mahbuba has been busy growing agricultural products for more than 11 years. She grows wheat and potatoes. Mahbuba works on her own land. She is the main breadwinner of her family as her husband is a migrant in Russia and doesn’t send enough money. She tries to educate her children and she wants to repair her house because she thinks that her children must live in a house that is in good condition. Mahbuba just finished sowing her land and that’s why she has no money to buy building materials to repair her house. She is asking for a loan of 5,000 Somoni to buy building materials such as cement, wood, and paint for repairing her house. She awaits your support. ",
