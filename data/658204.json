  "Name": "Exa",
  "description": "Exa is 49 years old and did not have the opportunity to go to school. She is currently alone as her life partner travelled to the US many years ago and they do not communicate. Exa does the household chores while her 21-year-old son is an evangelical pastor. He receives an income for his pastoral work.\r\n\r\nExa does the household chores and also grows plantains. Before growing bananas, Exa used to sow corn. She has now been growing bananas for four years, spending three hours every day cleaning and putting down fertiliser, and harvesting her products to sell them. Exa's only son is a pastor at a church in the neighbouring village.\r\n\r\nExa is applying for this loan from CrediCampo in order to buy a motorcycle, so that her son can travel to the churches where he works. He has a strict timetable and so needs a motorcycle. This will allow him to travel around more quickly.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Exa wants her son to train to be a Bible reader as he has the support of local pastors and churches. Exa wants to see her son became a great person.\r\n\r\n",
