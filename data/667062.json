  "description": "Micaela (first one from right to left in the photo) is a young lady of 27 years old, single and with four children. She lives with her family in Nahualá, Sololá. \r\n\r\nShe is an enthusiastic and visionary young woman with a desire to get ahead in life. She dedicates to the banana production and its sale. She does this beautiful activity in the community where she lives. Her parents, dedicated to the same business, taught her this activity and that is how they transfer all their knowledge and experience to her.  This work gives her enough income to support her beautiful family. She says that she likes this activity because it’s an honest one and she gets to help her community through it. She has over 14 years of experience in this business.\r\n\r\nWith the objective of giving back to her community, she decided to form a group so everyone could help each other, and this way improve their living standards. She will use this loan to buy supplies (fertilizers and payment of workers) to maintain the banana plantations.\r\n\r\nMicaela dreams of getting a piece of land so in the future she can pass it on to her children.  \r\n",
