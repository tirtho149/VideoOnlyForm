Her husband has machinery that treads out the grain, particularly corn, and he offers services to other people in the neighboring villages.<br /><br />Bardhe’s village is known for a high volume of grain production, and the villagers sell their produce to nearby food processing factories. The grazing in their village is a good food for animals, particularly cows, sheep and pigs. Hence, the main source of income for them is the animals and grains.",
