  "Name": "Armen",
  "description": "Armen lives in Apaga village with his parents, his wife and two little kids (ages 4 and 1 year old). He has been involved in agriculture. Mainly he keeps cows, pigs, and a calf as well as cultivating tomatoes, greens and some grass for the livestock.\r\n\r\nArmen is a hardworking young man who works day and night to be able to provide better living conditions for his family. By requesting this loan, he asks Kiva lenders to support him with the farm. The income that he gets from selling agricultural products at the market is hardly enough to cover the family's costs, and at the same time the farm needs some improvements. \r\n\r\nSo, Armen has requested this loan to purchase cucumber seeds, fertilizer and materials for renovation of the greenhouse. This will be huge help for Armen and he hopes that lenders will support him.\r\n\r\nAs this is Armen's first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn’t have access to credit products in the past because they have no credit history.\r\n",
