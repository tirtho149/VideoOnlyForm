  "Name": "Jesús Arsenio",
  "description": "Jesús, 38, went to school through the 4th grade.  Because of his parents' health and the need for household income he was not able to go farther.  He has a common-law wife and three children.  His partner works as a housekeeper.  His three children live with them and are in school.  No one else lives with them, just the family members who are dependent on Jesús's income.  \r\n\r\nJesús is a farmer, but he currently works as a security guard at a supermarket, which he's been doing for two years.  He previously worked only in agriculture.  He travels around 10km to work, one part by bike and the other by bus.  His work schedule runs from 7AM to 5PM.  \r\n\r\nJesús wants to finish an underground well he started.  It will be used to provide the water he needs daily because the area he lives in sorely lacks the vital liquid.  \r\n\r\nJesús's dream is that his family live more and more comfortably and that his house have water.  The water will benefit everything his wife does on a daily basis, because she won't have to travel to the river like she has always had to.  ",
