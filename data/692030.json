  "description": "Razia is a 43-year-old married woman. She has been successfully running a business selling milk to the people of her community. Over time, Razia has become famous in her area for providing good quality milk. She counts on a good client list and makes enough to contribute to her family's income. Razia's husband is employed in a textile mill but his income is not sufficient to meet the needs of the family. She also sells animals on a seasonal basis to generate extra money to contribute to the family income.  \r\n\r\nRazia is requesting a 40,000 PKR loan through the Kashf Foundation to purchase one more cow. She expects a boost in her earnings with her loan and plans to spend her profits on expanding her business.\r\n\r\n",
