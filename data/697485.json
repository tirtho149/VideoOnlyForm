  "description": "Atyrbubu has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a successive loan. She is a member of the Iigilik-3 group along with two other people. The loan she received previously allowed her to develop her business and receive profits of about 10,000 KGS from her farming, and she now has a 1.5 hectare piece of land on which she grows beans. Atyrbubu plans to use funds from this loan to cover the cost of mineral fertilizers, fuel and preparing the fields for spring planting. Profits will allow her to buy a bigger house for her loving family.",
