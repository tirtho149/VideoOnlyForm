  "description": "“MASS” NGO works with women who want to leave the Devadasi system and provides these women with employment opportunities so that they can provide a better future for their children. The Devadasi system is an ancient tradition in which a young girl is married or ‘dedicated’ to a deity and would perform religious rituals, The young women do not have a choice in this life long decision, which often leads to exploitation, poverty, and social exclusion.\r\n\r\nThe self-help group called “Laxmi Mahila Sangh” from MASS is located in Pamaldini village, Belgaum. This group consists of seven members, all former devadasis who are trying to achieve impressive things in life. All the group members meet once a week to discuss the loan, savings, repayment details and individual and community problems. All the members have taken a loan from MASS in the past and repaid it on time. \r\n\r\nYellavva, 48, is the featured borrower of this group. She is standing with her hand raised. She is living with her mother and son in their own house, which is provided by the government. Her elder son is married and living separately with his family. Yellavva has 20 years experience in goat rearing. She buys 1-2 month old kids and raises them. She also works as a laborer in agriculture fields. Her monthly income is around INR 4,000, as it fluctuates depending on her labor work.  \r\n\r\nYellavva now wants to expand her farm and for this reason, she needs to buy more goat kids. Hence, she is seeking a loan of INR 10,000. She hopes to save enough for her son who is studying ITI. She wants to see him in a good post.\r\n\r\nThe other six members are also requesting a loan for their goat-rearing business. \r\n",
