  "description": "Chamnan is a 27-year-old married woman. She lives in a remote area of Kampong Cham Province with her husband and three unmarried children. She and her spouse are farmers in the rice field near their house, with a daily income of about USD 3.\r\n\r\nChamnan has been a reliable client of HKL for one loan cycle already. Recently, she would like to request one more loan from KIVA to pay for a motorbike since she never has any vehicle to use. She hopes that this low interest loan can make her life more comfortable in transportation. Finally, she would like to express her thanks to all lenders in advance.\r\n",
