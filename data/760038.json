  "description": "Sughran is 37 years old and the mother of four children. She lives in Lahore, Pakistan. She is a housewife and looks after her family at home. Her husband works in dairy products, selling milk, curd and butter. He owns a small dairy farm consisting of buffaloes and cows. He sells milk daily to different tea stalls. He is an honest man. \r\n\r\nHe manages his household necessities with his earnings from milk sales. He speaks in a monotone which is impressive, and he easily wins the trust of his clients. He was in need of one more buffalo to increase his income through his milk sales business. So, Sughran demanded a loan. In this way she can support her husband’s milk sale business. She thanks Kiva and the field partner, BRAC Pakistan.\r\n",
