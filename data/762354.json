  "description": "Karen is passionate for women’s rights and social justice and brings this into her business in the coffee industry. Sit her down, and she’ll flood your brain with information about the inequities faced by women in the industry. But rather than being another “armchair activist” or “keyboard warrior”, Karen is someone who puts her words into action.\r\n\r\nShe has most recently done this by starting her company Coffee Cares’, which buys and sells coffee beans from sustainable, women-run coffee farms and provides microfinance loans to those women farmers. The company also sells a software platform to corporations that allows them to track the philanthropic activities of their employees, with added features such as allowing users to calculate tax deductions.\r\n\r\nTrying to increase cash flow to make larger purchases, Karen will use her Kiva loan to buy more coffee to import to the United States.\r\n\r\nBeing a trailblazer is not easy. Karen started the business with no money and was the second woman CEO of a coffee company in the US. The coffee industry has historically been a male-dominated industry; however, with her strident, outspoken voice, Karen is making waves and the industry will not stay that way for long.",
