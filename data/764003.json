He has been driving a tractor for 6 years now. He is the sole earner in the family. He uses his tractor for agricultural purposes like transporting agricultural produce, manure, urea, and other items to different locations. A proper fuel supply is important to ensure that transportation is not hindered. But he cannot afford to buy fuel due to financial constraints.
