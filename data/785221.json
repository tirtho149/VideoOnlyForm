  "description": "Orlando is 49 years old. He never had the opportunity to go to school, since his parents did not believe in studying and only sent him to work. He is married and with his wife he tends to corn mill he has. All three of his children are married. \r\n\r\nOrlando has earned a living over the past 7 years by managing a farm in his area. He also works in agriculture, and he learned this from his parents since he was a child. He commutes 2 kilometers by bicycle to get to work which he does from 6:00AM to 5:00PM. This is when he returns home to help with the household chores.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting is for graduation expenses for his granddaughter who is in Kindergarden and whom he loves very much. Orlando dreams of having cows on pastures so that he can earn more money apart from his work as a manager.",
