  "description": "Gerardo is a 52 year old farmer who is hardworking and humble.  As a child he learned how to perform all types of farming tasks, thanks to the teachings of his parents. This has allowed him to make progress and today he has crops of carrots, bananas and passion fruit.  He attends to the crops every day and then sells then in the center plaza of the municipal market of Santa Fe De Antioquia.  Also, he works as a laborer in different farms of the region. With this work he supplements his income to take care of the well-being of his family and help them get by.  \r\n\r\nWith the help of the loan he will buy agricultural supplies in bulk (compost, pesticides, fertilizers and others). With this he will continue to care for his crops and will obtain a better, more productive harvest.  This will allow him to make better profits in the moment of selling his produce. Gerardo, with his entrepreneurial spirit and tenacity, wants to keep fighting to achieve his goals and have his own farm.  That way he can harvest a bigger variety of produce and ensure better profitability for his business, guarantying economic stability to give his family a better quality of life.\r\n \r\n\r\n",
