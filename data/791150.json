  "Name": "José Isabel",
  "description": "José is 71 years old. He works farming and raising livestock. He wasn't able to go to school due to his financial situation. He grew up with his parents, who taught him the business. He lives alone with his wife, since his children have already moved out and live on their own.\r\n\r\nJosé has been farming for over forty years. He works the land in the mornings and milks the cows in the afternoons. His wife is a homemaker.\r\n\r\nHe will use the loan he is requesting to buy a heifer, which will help him increase his milk production in the coming months. This will help him support his household. José expects the income he earns from his business to allow him to work debt-free soon.",
