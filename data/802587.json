  "description": "Nelson's Group is formed by 16 farmers in Kakamega south district, and is being represented by Nelson, who is the group leader pictured above. He is 42 years old, is married, and has four children. Nelson has been a farmer for 10 years, and is often referred to as a very hardworking individual.\r\n\r\nNelson isn’t new to One Acre Fund; he actually joined the program in 2013, and has since noticed his life has changed, especially in the sense that he has been able to consistently feed his family ever since. This year, Nelson will not only get fertilizer and maize seeds as part of his loan, but will also purchase a solar light. He is very excited about this addition since now he will be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel, and therefore save more money.\r\n\r\nUsing this loan, Nelson's Group will purchase a total of 10 solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of 10 acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n",
