  "description": "Mikheil is 49 years old and lives with his wife and their three children in the village of Agaraki. He was a teacher at Waldorf School Tbilisi. After a stay in Germany for extension studies, he came back to Georgia but could not find work as a teacher anymore. He found only a part-time job at a window production company, which does not generate enough income to support his family.\r\n\r\nInspired by organic animal husbandry he had come in contact with in Germany, he decided to keep milk cows and produce dairy products to have additional income. He makes cheese and Georgian-style yogurt called matsoni. In order to have healthy natural products, his cows are only fed grass, hay and grain but no antibiotics or other additives. According to the anthroposophic teaching, Mikheil makes a point of respect and good surroundings for his animals, which has a positive effect on the milk they give.\r\n\r\nMost of the cheese, yogurt and milk is sold at the Waldorf school for the pupils and their families. In this way, they have the opportunity to buy high-quality healthy dairy products. With the help of the loan, Mikheil will buy six more milk cows.",
