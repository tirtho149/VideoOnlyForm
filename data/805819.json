  "description": "Zakayo is the father of five children, all of whom are female. His goal is to allow these five beautiful flowers to attend universities and study whatever they would like in order to become great professionals. Zakayo does not want to deny them this pleasure, which is why he is requesting a loan.\r\n\r\nZakayo is 26 years of age, a hard worker, and always says, “I eat from my sweat.” He is based in Kamoiywa, a rural village in the rich highlands of Eldoret. He has been practicing farming for the past five years, and has never looked back. His primary sources of income have been eggs, milk, and crops. Most of the small holder farmers in Kamoiywa village own approximately one acre per household and this has made them work extra hard to fully utilize their farms. Zakayo has been practicing mixed farming and he enjoys the income he gets, but he has been facing challenges delivering his products to the market. Kamoiywa village is a very remote area and the roads are in pathetic condition. This has hampered Zakayo from making timely delivery of products to the market while still fresh. Zakayo sells vegetables, milk, and tomatoes, which are very perishable and require quick delivery if you are to fetch a high price.\r\n\r\nZakayo is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike that will help him deliver his products to the market in a timely manner and overcome the challenge of facing losses. With the loan, he will deliver the products to the market on time and this means he will never suffer losses, which will translate into an immediate increase in profits. Zakayo plans to employ someone who will help him on the farm and deliver products to his large client base. Profits from the loan will be used to comfortably repay the loan in full and invest in a solid foundation for his family to come.\r\n",
