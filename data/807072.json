To make additional income for the family, Khitmah  chose to buy honey from her brothers at wholesale prices and sell them back in Zarqa, where she lives, at market prices. Being a \"people person\" she was able to promote her small home business. Now Khitmah is applying for a loan to increase her order of honey, and begin selling other food such as dairy products.",
