  "Name": "Dickson's Group",
  "description": "Dickson is 60 years old and has 10 children. He is representing his group formed by 16 farmers in Webuye District, Kenya. \r\n\r\nDickson has been farming with One Acre Fund for years now, having joined the program for the first time in 2010. This decision was largely a result of his desire to earn enough to send his children to school. Although he described his last harvest as good, he believes he could have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. Dickson also decided to purchase a solar light as part of his loan, which he is very excited about, as it will allow him to have light during dark hours for his children to be able to study.\r\n\r\nObtaining this loan means that Dickson's Group will be able to receive a total of 10 solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 9.75 acres.\t\t\t\t\t\r\n",
