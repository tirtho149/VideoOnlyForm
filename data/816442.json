  "Name": "Daniel Magaji",
  "description": "Daniel Magaji is a maize farmer from Ranau Danmantai village in Kaduna state. Before he became a Babban Gona member, Daniel Magaji would have had to sell his maize at low prices soon after harvest to meet his immediate cash needs. With this loan and Babban Gona’s support, Daniel Magaji can now store his maize at harvest time and sell it a few months later for up to 40% higher than the market price at harvest. Daniel Magaji, like other members of Babban Gona, intends to use the extra income to provide food and clothing for his family, and hopes to ensure his children are educated and have professional jobs.\r\n",
