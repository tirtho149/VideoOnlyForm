  "description": "Work in the countryside is one of the hardest jobs these days for the huge effort which is needed to progress, but Nicolás is a man who never has given up due to the weather or the circumstances which could happen to him. He is always ready to get resources for his family. \r\n\r\nHe gets up in the early hours of the morning to go to distant farms to fulfill his work obligations.\r\n\r\nHe alternates this work with the sale of milk he gets from his own cows. \r\n\r\nHe wants to increase his working capital to guarantee the sustenance of his business and this is the reason that brings him to ask for a loan to invest in the purchase of a dairy cow that will give a good boost to his business. \r\n",
