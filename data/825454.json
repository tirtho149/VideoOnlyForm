For the past four years she has also been working in animal husbandry, a business she began with the purchase of livestock for 25,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, she now has two cows and 10 sheep on her farm with a monthly income of 15,000 KGS.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Gulzhan has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 50,000 KGS to purchase a dairy cow to increase the amount of flavourful organic milk she can sell. She plans to put profits from the loan into further increasing her number of livestock.",
