They have 23 goats, 2 pigs and some chickens, and sell the products to the farmer’s markets and food stores and restaurants in the area. They also have grapevines and orchards like plums and persimmons. As for seasonal veggies, Dila plants mostly red and white cabbage, leeks, spinach, tomatoes and onions.  Their earnings are generated by the sales of baby goats and piglets and income Vlash receives from his work as a road maintenance guy. \r\n\r\nVlash is seeking your financial help to pay for the pension contribution of farmers. \r\n",
