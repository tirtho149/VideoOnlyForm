  "Name": "Jesús Gilberto",
  "description": "Jesús is a young man originally  from the warm city of Piura, located in northern Peru. Along with his family, they emigrated to the city of Lima, searching for a promising future based on effort and dedication. His father is a farmer, and he works as a temporary laborer. His mother is a homemaker dedicated to raising his brother.  Jesus began working at a young age (10 years old) helping his father in the farm, where he only earned tips. He is currently studying in the third cycle of Graphic Design at SENATI. He likes this field very much and he feels that this career will be a great economic resource to be able to help his family. Due to his parents current economic situation, he is coming to KIVA to ask for support and be able to finish his career successfully. Had he not been able to have access to this loan, he would unfortunately have had to withdraw to work until he had enough money saved to finish his studies. Jesus is very grateful for the support received from KIVA, because this will allow him to meet his personal and professional goals, thus being able to help his family by becoming an excellent professional.",
