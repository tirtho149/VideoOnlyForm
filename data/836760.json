  "description": "After 14 years of experience in the agricultural sector, and following the advice of his former professor at the Agricultural Technical School, Benito established a rural organization in the north of Haiti. That organization includes mostly agronomists and agricultural technicians and their main activity is the preparation and marketing of various seedlings. Benito's organization has participated in projects with various institutions and individuals working in the agricultural sector.The committee board is composed as follows: Benito as coordinator, Henry as his Assistant, Fleurise as secretary, René as head of Project and Dejoie as Advisor.\n\nAs part of the Project of USAID/AVANSE, his organization was selected to provide seedlings to Northern farmers. Throughout this partnership, his organization will create two new part-time jobs. To do this, a loan is essential for the organization. That's why this organization turned to Zafèn. Trough a partnership with Zafen, PADF has already supported this project up to 25%. Therefore the amount posted on kiva is 75%.\n",
