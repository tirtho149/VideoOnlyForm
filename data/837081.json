  "description": "This is Valentino, a 31-year-old married father of two young children, aged 7 and 2, who is seeking your compassion to help him make some basic repairs to the home where his two young children live. Kindly note that the town where his family resides is in the coldest part of the country; thus, by helping him financially you have helped his young children live in a warmer environment.  \r\n\r\nFor the past four years, Valentino’s focus has been on livestock; he has two cows and sells about 40 liters of milk a day at a price of $0.4 per liter. Had he sold the milk directly to clients, then the price would have been $1 per liter, instead of selling to a dairy farm. He also has a sow from which he sells about eight piglets every year. On the eight dynym piece of land that he owns, he plants mostly corn, wheat, fodder and beets, all these are used for his animals. \r\n",
