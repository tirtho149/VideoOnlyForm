  "description": "This community is located in Htaung Mhu Chaung Village, Myanmar Ayeyarwaddy Delta region and consists of 19 village customers of which five are CBO (Community Based Organization) committee members helping lead the loan program in the area. This loan will help some group members purchase high-quality feed (costing $30 a week to feed 100 ducks) that will boost their income from more duck eggs. The other members will use the funds to repair their duck farms (costing $40-$50 for a 100-duck farm). \r\nHtaung Mhu Chaung Village has over 700 households.  Besides duck raising, many villagers grow rice and seasonal vegetables and raise other livestock such as pigs and chickens.\r\nPictured above are the CBO members from Htaung Mhu Chaung Group 1 Village, named U Than, U Bar, U Pyae, U Kyaw and U Zaw. Included in the picture, U Than (second from right) is 49 years old and married with three children. His wife raises their 160 ducks. U Than's two eldest children are working in the city and the youngest is a student living in their house. He also helps raise the family's pigs, a source of savings. U Than has been raising ducks for over 20 years and like other members, he will use the Proximity loan to purchase high-quality feed for his ducks that will boost his income.  This boost is critical in enabling U Than and his family to continue supporting his youngest child's ongoing education. ",
