  "Name": "Gladness",
  "description": "Gladness is a 49-year-old single mother of two girls, aged 25 and 12. \r\n\r\nHer entrepreneurial spirit prompted Gladness to sell her small liquor business and venture into farming, specifically, horticulture. This turned out to be a lucrative gamble, as she has rapidly created a market for her products.  As a result, she is able to provide for her family and educate her girls.  In fact, her oldest daughter recently earned a degree in agriculture and is determined to help her mother take the farm to the next level.\r\n\r\nGladness is requesting a loan to buy a windmill. The farming community within her area does not have stable access to water, relying on vendors who sell water at a high price. This has had considerable cost implications and has greatly impacted their revenue. \r\n\r\nGladness already took initiative and dug a well, and now only needs the windmill to pump water from the well. She decided to use a windmill to take advantage of wind as a natural, renewable resource that does not have the negative impacts on the environment compared to generators or other mechanical pumps.\r\n\r\nShe believes that by securing a stable water source, the farm will cut down on costs while simultaneously improving on productivity. Water will not only boost her farm but benefit her community by providing clean water for other's domestic use. ",
