  "Name": "Judith's Group",
  "description": "Judith is 49 years old and has seven children. She is a group leader and is representing her group formed by 16 farmers in Webuye District, Kenya. \r\n\r\nJudith has been farming with One Acre Fund for years now, having joined the program for the first time in 2010. This decision was largely a result of her desire to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods, and although she described her last harvest as very good, she believes she could have a better one this year by continuing to work alongside One Acre Fund. Judith also decided to purchase a solar light as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to have light during dark hours for her children to be able to study.\r\n\r\nObtaining this loan means that Judith's Group will be able to receive a total of 14 solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 9.25 acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n",
