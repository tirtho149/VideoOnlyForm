  "description": "Romie, a farmer from San Mariano, Isabela, is married to an overseas Filipino worker and blessed with three children. Even though the two of them are earning income, it is sometimes insufficient to meet all the needs of their children. That is why, to send his son to college, Romie wants to borrow a PHP 200,000 education loan from Kiva lenders. That amount will pay for his son's tuition fees. His son Richard is studying for a bachelor of science degree in accountancy because he dreams of becoming a successful certified public accountant.",
