  "description": "Janepher is 34 years old and has six children. She is a group leader and is representing her group formed by 12 farmers in Webuye District, Kenya. \r\n\r\nJanepher has been farming with One Acre Fund for years now, having joined the program for the first time in 2011. This decision was largely a result of her desire to earn enough to feed her family, and, although she described her last harvest as good, she believes she could have a better one this year by continuing to work alongside One Acre Fund. \r\n\r\nJanepher also decided to purchase a solar light as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to have an overall improved quality of life.\r\n\r\nObtaining this loan means that Janepher's Group will be able to receive a total of four solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 5.75 acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n",
