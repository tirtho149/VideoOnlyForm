  "description": "Sửu is 39 years old, married and has three children. For the past ten years she has farmed in Nong Cong district, a rural area in Thanh Hoa province.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2011, Sửu joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women, from which she obtained and successfully repaid a loan. She is now applying for a 13,000,000 VND loan to buy sand, cement, bricks and equipment to build a Biogas system. These biodigestor systems transform livestock waste into biogas, which can be used for cooking, heating and lighting.\r\n<p>\r\nSửu’s hope is to continue farming successfully, that her children find good jobs and the family to be healthy and happy.\r\n",
