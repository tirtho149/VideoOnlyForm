  "description": "Paata is a farmer in a village in Gori region. With passion he grows different field crops and fruits. Recently, he has started to build up a hazelnut field. The soil in this region is very eutrophic, so that the hazelnut trees do not need any chemical fertilizers and produce ecologically sound nuts of excellent quality. The Georgian market for hazelnuts is very good, the producers have no problems selling. \r\n\r\nThe shortage of water is an important concern for the regional agriculture. The wells must reach deeper and deeper for the groundwater. So Paata decided to install an efficient drip irrigation system on his farm. It takes only as much water to the plants as they need, nothing is wasted. The loan allows Paata to buy and install the necessary water tanks and tubes.",
