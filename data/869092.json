  "Name": "Margaret's Group",
  "description": "Margaret, pictured above, has been a farmer for 10 years, and is now proud to represent her group of 11 farmers in Butere District. She is 41 years old,  married and the mother of sixchildren.\r\n\r\nMargaret likes to think of herself as a very hardworking individual. She has been working alongside One Acre Fund since 2014 and decided to represent her group because she wanted to help more farmers. She says that being part of the One Acre Fund community has meant that she has had more profits from each harvest. Margaret plans to use the profits from this coming season to buy more land to cultivate.\r\n\r\nIn total, Margaret’s Group will receive inputs to cultivate 8.25 acres of land. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 10 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n",
