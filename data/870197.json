  "description": "Musa is 28 years old, and is often described as a very hard-working individual. He has 3 children and is married. As a group leader, Musa is representing his group of 11 farmers in Butere District in Kenya, and is very excited to be working with One Acre Fund for the first time this year.\r\n\r\nThe decision to join One Acre Fund was largely a result of Musa's desire to earn enough to feed his family. Apart from receiving farming inputs, he is also purchasing a solar light as part of his loan, which is very exciting to him as he will now be able to have an overall improved quality of life. With the profits that he gains from this year’s harvest, he plans to buy a goat.\r\n\r\nMusa and his group will receive a total of 9 solar lights as well as input loans of maize and fertilizer to plant a total of 6 acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n",
