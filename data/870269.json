  "Name": "Jacob's Group",
  "description": "Jacob is 48 years old and has six children. He is a group leader and is representing his group formed by ten farmers in Butere District, Kenya. \r\n\r\nJacob has been farming with One Acre Fund for years now, having joined the program for the first time in 2011. This decision was largely a result of his desire to have access to quality training and to acquire new farming methods. \r\n\r\nAlthough he described his last harvest as very good, he believes he could have a better one this year by continuing to work alongside One Acre Fund. Jacob also decided to purchase a solar light as part of his loan, which he is very excited about, as it will allow him to have light during dark hours for his children to study by.\r\n\r\nObtaining this loan means that Jacob's Group will be able to receive a total of six solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of six acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n",
