  "description": "Kristi is 28 years old and recently married; he lives in southeastern Albania with his wife and his elderly father because his mother passed away this past year. \r\n\r\nHe wants to start planting and selling cyani flowers (cornflowers), which are very beautiful seen in the field, with intense blue colour and blue pigments. They are used as a decaffeinated herbal tea. Some years back planting, selling and exporting this particular plant was a project implemented by EuroPartners Development in the Korca region, where Kristi lives, and the Chamber of Grevena. \r\n\r\nUntil recently, Kristi bought and sold fruits and vegetables and also worked in a nearby hotel as a waiter. \r\n\r\nThe reason why he is requesting this loan is to prepare the land for planting the cyani flowers and to do other things this flower might require. \r\n",
