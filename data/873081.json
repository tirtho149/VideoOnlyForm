  "Name": "Catherine's Group",
  "description": "\"Catherine is 50 years old and has 9 children. She is a group leader and is representing her group formed by 14 farmers in Matete District, Kenya. \n\nCatherine has been farming with One Acre Fund for years now, having joined the program for the first time in 2011. This decision was largely a result of her desire to earn enough to feed her family and, although she described her last harvest as poor due to bad weather conditions, she believes she could have a better one this year by continuing to work alongside One Acre Fund. Catherine also decided to purchase a solar light as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.\n\nObtaining this loan means that Catherine's Group will be able to receive a total of 3 solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 7.25 acres.\"",
