  "description": "Shahida is 45 years old, the mother of five children and living with her spouse and children in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. Her elder son has owned a nursery farm business for the last two years where he sells different kinds of plants. Mostly, he focuses on flower plants, fruit plants, and some export quality plants to sell to his customers. He prefers quality instead of quantity in his nursery farming business. He has been feeding his family through the generated income from this nursery farm business. <br /><br />Now, the needs of his family have increased suddenly and he does not have other sources to cope with these needs, so he decided to expand his current business. He wants to increase his stock so that he can maximize sales from the business.<br /><br />Therefore, Shahida requested a loan from Kiva’s field partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that her son can buy kinds of plants to sell. Shahida thanks Kiva and field partner, BRAC Pakistan.",
