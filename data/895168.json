  "Name": "Ibrahim",
  "description": "This is 41-year-old Ibrahim. He is married and has two children five years old and six months old. He has one additional dependent who lives with him for his schooling. In 2008, Ibrahim established his electrical appliance business. He began his business because he chose it as his occupation. His business is located in the city center and his main customers are men. Working 6 days a week and 10 hours a day, he earns about 500,000 SLL every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of 5,000,000 SLL. Ibrahim now requires a new loan in order to buy plasmas, DVDs, freezers, etc. for resale. He hopes that this loan will help to add stock and maximize profit. In the future, he would like to travel to buy his stock instead of buying from wholesalers. He thanks you for your support.",
