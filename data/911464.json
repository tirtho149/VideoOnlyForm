  "Name": "Ramon",
  "description": "Ramon is a farmer who lives in a region called Takinta, a highly marginalized area with less than twenty residents located in the municipality of Ocosingo in Chiapas. There because of the favorable climate, coffee is grown. \r\n<p>\r\nRamon lives with his wife and children in a house without basic services such as electricity. He is a farmer who cultivates not only coffee but also corn on a seasonal basis. \r\n<p>\r\nBecause the family must use candles and wood as a source of light, Ramon wants to purchase a solar-powered lighting system. He has applied for a 3,190 MXN loan through Kiva's field partner ERES Energía Renovable to buy one. With it the family will be able to see at night, the children will be able to do their homework after sunset, and the family will have light for other activities such as cooking.\r\n",
