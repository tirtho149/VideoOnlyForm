  "Name": "Mendoza Group",
  "description": "The community from which the Mendoza group originates can only be accessed by traveling along a dirt road for about two hours. For this reason, if the inhabitants do not have a method of transportation, they must request a taxi or ask a neighbor to take them. The majority of the population works in the fields due to the richness of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe group members are: Guadalupe, who sells sugar, corn, beans, and chili peppers; José Luis, who sells meat; José and José Ambrosio, who sell sugar cane; and Claudio, who raises livestock and grows sugar cane.\r\n\r\nClaudio is a man of very rooted traditions. He can always be seen wearing boots, a checkered shirt, and hat, which he mentions is characteristic of his family. He is married to Eudocia and is the father of two children. He was able to offer professional education to his children thanks to the income he earned through sugar cane production and livestock sales.\r\n\r\n“Sugar cane production is a profession that has been in my family for many generations. Each one of us learns from his father this work and love of the earth that provides us with food,” he says with satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThanks to previous loans, Claudio was able to buy the fertilizer and manure that he needs to sufficiently grow the sugar cane. With this current loan, he will invest again in manure and fertilizer which do not harm the pastures that the livestock eat. For Claudio, it is of great importance that his children show interest in farming and continue the family legacy once he is no longer around. He proudly adds, “I have grown out of the countryside, and it continues to support me. For this reason, I am determined and will bring worth to the work of the fields.”\r\n\r\nThe Mendoza group is thankful for the trust of the people who make it possible for these loans to be granted.",
