  "description": "29-year-old Mirian lives in Kakheti region in eastern Georgia. He is married with one child. In his main job he works as a house painter. And he is a spare-time farmer. At a friend's place, he saw the greenhouse which is shown in the photo. It made him curious and he decided to build his own one in the same design. As a skilled craftsman, he will be able to do the construction work himself.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the loan, Mirian will buy the necessary iron rods, greenhouse film and drip irrigation system. This irrigation gives the plants only as much water as they need, nothing is wasted. This is important because water is short and precious in the region.\r\n\r\nHe will be able to grow more vegetables, expand the growing season and protect the plants from storm and hail. He sells the harvest locally\r\n",
