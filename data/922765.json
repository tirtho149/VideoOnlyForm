  "Name": "Lemune",
  "description": " Lemune is 56 years old and married. In her family she has two children. She is from Imisli. She is successful and very diligent farmer. She has started to work in her field 28 years ago . She buys seeds (fruits and vegetables) from other markets and sows them in her land. People prefer to buy fruits and vegetables from private gardens, because they are naturally raised and cheaper. People know that such products are always fresh and healthy; they are not grown with different pesticides and are not harmful. \r\n\r\nDuring long years of experience, Lemune was taught how to cover customer`s demands. So, selling fruits and vegetables from houses is popular and cheaper for people than buying them in bazaars and big markets. Her biggest dream is to expand her land and to plant more seeds. But, for this, she has to have some funds. \r\n\r\nWith this loan she will purchase more land and sow more seeds. We need Kiva lenders to support Lemune.",
