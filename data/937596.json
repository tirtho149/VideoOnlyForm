  "description": "Dorofia (56) is a divorced mother of four. She is a respected elder in her community where she is known for her caring nature. Even as she ages, Dorofia still has the zeal and drive to work. She is a founding member of a self-help group that has identified an opportunity in agriculture. The group secured land and has erected tunnels (greenhouses) for crop farming. <br /><br />She is requesting a Kiva loan to help her buy organic seedlings to grow in the greenhouse. She will then supply the vegetables to small-scale vendors in her neighborhood. <br /><br />\"I hope to create jobs for other people,\" says Dorofia when asked about her 5-year plan.",
