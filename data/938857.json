  "Name": "Wilver",
  "description": "Wilver is 33 and wants to keep working so he can provide his three daughters with a better quality of life and send them to school so they can be respectable women in the future, which is what his wife who passed away several years ago wanted.  He lives in the community of Olanchito, Honduras and he has been growing vegetables and coffee for 12 years, so he knows that for this work you have to get up early and keep working through the night when it's time to harvest the coffee.  One of his wishes is to find a good woman and get married again; he would also like to increase his harvest yields and in the future be able to buy a vehicle so he could go out and sell his produce.  Wilver's daughters are currently facing a problem because they cannot study or complete school assignments at night because they do not have electricity.  For this reason, Wilver is requesting a loan from Soluz Honduras to get a solar power system, which would improve living conditions for himself and his girls.",
