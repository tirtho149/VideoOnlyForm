The feed consists of organic alfalfa that he grows himself. He seeks a microloan in order to be able to buy 4 organic cows. He hopes to sell the milk at a better price since it will be organic. In the future he hopes to be able to provide economic stability to his wife and above all to be able to have good health, which is why he supports organic, in order to be with her for many more years.",
