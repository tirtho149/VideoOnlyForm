  "description": "Kimsrim, who is a farmer from Kampong Cham province, is 33 years old and she is married. She is blessed with five children, four of whom are in school while the remaining one is too young to attend school. She and her husband grow jicama to earn main source of income. Moreover, they earn additional income by raising cows and horses and sometimes working as construction worker. \nBecause Kimsrim is in need of working capital, she is now leading a two members group to apply for loan from VisionFund. As the group leader, she is going to use her loan to buy organic fertilizer to boost crop yields. She hopes that this purchase will let her crop grow well so that she can improve living condition and support her children’s studying.",
