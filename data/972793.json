  "Name": "Roda",
  "description": "Roda is a married mother of three children. She keeps cattle and poultry for milk, eggs, and meat. On her one-acre piece of land, you will also find a granary, cereals, and over 50 trees. \r\n\r\nTo make better income, Roda engages in cereal brokering, which involves arranging the logistics of getting farm produce from local farmers to their buyers. Over the ten years that she has been in the business, she has made an effort to build strong relationships because in this business, success depends on reputation.\r\n\r\nSince she can arrange a sale more easily than regular farmers, Roda prefers to deal with larger volumes of produce. She is seeking a loan to build her inventory by buying more cereal produce from local farmers at competitive prices. She will use her understanding of the market conditions and prices to sell later at a profit. \r\n\r\nYour loan will help local farmers selling to Roda to focus on production, rather than sales. Roda’s family also stands to benefit greatly from the improved income and elevated livelihood. You can help Roda with the loan she needs and get her closer to accomplishing her dreams.\r\n",
