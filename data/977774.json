  "description": "Julia, 38, has been farming for the past 10 years. Over this time, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She practices mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, vegetables, and other various crops, as well as some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. Although she makes profits from farming, she is not doing comfortably and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. \r\n\r\nThat is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. Kenya's Nandihills area, one of the country's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Julia could increase her profits by satisfying the demand. Julia believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the market's demand for cereals. Julia also believes that the extra income she earns will enable a permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Julia to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going children.\r\n",
