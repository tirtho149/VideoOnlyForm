  "description": "Joseph, pictured above, is a group leader and is representing his group formed by 12 farmers in Bungoma District, Kenya. He joined One Acre Fund for the first time in 2010 and decided to represent his group because he wanted to help more farmers. He is married and has four children.<br /><br />With a portion of this loan, Joseph will not only purchase maize seeds and fertilizer for the coming harvesting season, but also a solar light. Receiving a solar light as part of his loan means that now he will be able to have an overall improved quality of life. Joseph plans to use the profits he gains this year to invest in a business.<br /><br />In total, Joseph’s Group will use the inputs received from this loan to plant a total of 6.25 acres of land. They will also receive a total of four solar lights.",
