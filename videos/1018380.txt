0–3 sec: A wide shot of a vibrant, sun-dappled field in Webuye District, Kenya. The early morning light casts a warm glow over the patchwork of green crops. Violet, a dignified woman in her late thirties, stands at the edge of the field, her hands resting on a hoe. She wears a simple, colorful dress and a headscarf, radiating calm determination.

3–6 sec: A close-up of Violet's hands as she skillfully works the soil with the hoe, the rich earth turning under her touch. Her movements are steady and practiced, revealing her experience. The texture of the soil is visible, dark and fertile, a testament to her hard work and the promise of a good harvest.

6–9 sec: A medium shot reveals the challenge: a section of the field where the crops are sparse, and the ground is dry. Violet pauses, wiping her brow with a weary yet resolute expression. Her eyes scan the land thoughtfully, considering the work ahead.

9–12 sec: The camera captures a moment of hope as the sun breaks through the clouds, illuminating Violet's face. She smiles softly, her eyes alight with determination. Nearby, a fellow farmer arrives with a solar light, symbolizing the brighter future Violet and her group are working towards.
