**0–3 sec:**  
A wide shot captures the serene morning light over a lush, green field in Korca. Melsi, dressed in traditional farming attire, stands among rows of vibrant vegetables. The air is still, with a gentle mist lingering above the crops, hinting at the early hour.

**3–6 sec:**  
The camera transitions to a close-up of Melsi's hands skillfully planting young nut saplings into the rich soil. His movements are practiced and deliberate, fingers pressing the earth firmly around each plant. Nearby, a simple wooden crate holds more saplings, waiting to be embedded into the land.

**6–9 sec:**  
A slow pan reveals the expanse of the farm, highlighting patches of tilled but unplanted land. Melsi pauses briefly, a hint of fatigue on his face, glancing at the weathered tools beside him. The soil looks dry, and the space seems vast, suggesting the hard work ahead.

**9–12 sec:**  
The sun breaks through the clouds, casting a warm glow over the field. Melsi stands tall, a faint, hopeful smile on his face as he looks towards the planted trees. A light breeze rustles the leaves, embodying a sense of growth and future promise.
