0–3 sec: The scene opens with a wide shot of a sun-drenched rice field in Sierra Leone. The warm, golden light of early morning casts long shadows across the lush green paddies. Umbalu, a dedicated farmer, stands at the forefront, her body framed by the verdant rows of rice. Her expression is one of quiet determination, reflecting the dawn of a promising day.

The texture of the rich soil and the delicate green shoots are captured in vivid detail, emphasizing the tactile connection between her hands and the land she nurtures.

6–9 sec: A mid-shot reveals the challenge: a nearby plot shows signs of struggle, with fewer seedlings and dry patches hinting at the resource constraints. Umbalu pauses, wiping her brow with the back of her hand. The sun glints off her slightly weary expression, a testament to the hard work and limited means.

9–12 sec: The scene concludes with Umbalu standing tall, a gentle smile emerging as she observes a fellow farmer joining her in the field. The camera pans upwards, capturing the sun breaking through the clouds, casting a hopeful light over the landscape, symbolizing resilience and communal progress.
