Hector, wearing a straw hat and a well-worn shirt, stands among rows of vibrant orange trees, their branches heavy with fruit.

**6–9 sec:**  
The camera shifts to a medium shot of Hector as he pauses, wiping sweat from his brow with a sun-darkened hand. Nearby, a small pile of empty fertilizer bags highlights the resources he lacks. His gaze momentarily drifts to the horizon, reflecting a quiet determination despite the visible fatigue.
