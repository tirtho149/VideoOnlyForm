3–6 sec: Pedro carefully wraps fresh produce in cloth, his hands moving with practiced ease. The textures of the vegetables and the well-used cloth are evident, each piece handled with care. His expression is focused, a quiet dedication in his eyes.

6–9 sec: He looks towards an empty space where a fridge would stand. The absence is felt as he pauses, a slight weariness in his posture. A small table holds jars of preserves, highlighting the need for better storage solutions.

9–12 sec: Pedro glances out the window, where sunlight dances on a distant field. A gentle smile spreads across his face, reflecting hope and determination. The scene closes with a soft breeze rustling a curtain, symbolizing change and the promise of progress.
