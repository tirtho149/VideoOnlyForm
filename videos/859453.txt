6–9 sec: The camera pans to reveal a nearly empty barn, shelves sparse of supplies, and Fredy's expression, subtly weary yet determined. The presence of worn-out tools and a small milk container hint at the challenges he faces in maintaining his dairy business.

9–12 sec: The scene ends with Fredy's gentle smile as he looks towards the pasture, where a calf playfully nudges its mother. Sunlight breaks through the clouds, illuminating the field, symbolizing hope and Fredy's unwavering commitment to improving his livelihood.
